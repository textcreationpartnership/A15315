            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:489:3"/>
haue vſed in impugning my doctrine, and in maintaining their owne, and diligently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the reaſons, which did moue me to write, I make no doubt, but that <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceiue, that I am free from all temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſumption, and that I am very cleere from all thoſe ſlanderous imputations, whereof ſome men haue in publike writings falſely accuſed me, and that with farre greater reaſon I could returne their calumnies againſt me, backe vpon them ſelues.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And firſt of all <hi>it was neuer my meaning,</hi> as heretofore<note n="a" place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeticall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare</hi> num. 8. and in the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſweare it ſelfe nu. 111.</note> in the verie ſame words I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>when I did ſet forth my</hi> Apologie <hi>for the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of Princes againſt Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>to impugne the common opinion of Diuines, which granteth to the</hi> Pope authoritie <hi>to depoſe Princes, as</hi> apparantly falſe, and with inuincible arguments to demonſtrate <hi>the contrarie opinion to be true; but whereas ſome very few later Diuines, and eſpecially Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine <hi>only in a later Edition of his workes, yet bringing no other reaſon to proue the ſame, then in his former Editions hee had brought, doe ſo ſtifly, and with ſuch vehemencie defend this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the</hi> Popes Holineſſe <hi>to depoſe Princes, that they imagine to haue moſt cleerely conuinced the ſame,</hi> and feare not to charge with hereſie all thoſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, who in this point doe not run with them; this only was my intent,</hi> (to the end I might learne the truth in a matter of ſo great importance, as is to know what is hereſie) <hi>to giue at the leaſt a probable anſweare to the arguments of</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:489:3"/>
(whom rather then any other writer I tooke vpon me to confute, both for that he had out of all the beſt writers gathered all the chiefeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which to proue this authoritie were moſt forcible, &amp; alſo for that he being now aliue knew beſt how to maintaine his owne opinion, and being a queſtion of ſuch great moment, would alſo by all likelihood defend the ſame) and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently I did only intend to ſhew</hi> probably <hi>out of his owne principles, and not</hi> inuincibly to conuince, <hi>that his arguments for confirming this authoritie were not ſo</hi> certain &amp; inſoluble <hi>that as they did</hi> euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate, <hi>that thoſe Catholikes, who doe not approue the ſaid authoritie, are not to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the faithfull, and true beleeuers, or not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the participation of holy Sacraments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſent controuerſie, which is at this time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me, and Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine <hi>is not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this</hi> abſolute queſtion or propoſition, <hi>which the Diuines doe commonly defend, to wit, whether the Pope hath authoritie to depoſe Princes for hereſie, but concerning this</hi> modall propoſition, <hi>Whether it be ſo certaine, and without all controuerſie, that the</hi> Pope <hi>by Chriſts inſtitution hath the ſaid authoritie to depoſe Princes, as that thoſe, who defend the contrarie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be probable, doe expoſe themſelues to manifeſt danger of hereſie, error, or any other mortall ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 By which it is euident, that I haue not taken vpon me <hi>to demonſtrate,</hi> but only <hi>to anſweare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably;</hi> and therefore I can not iuſtly be blamed, if I haue not brought altogether <hi>demonſtratiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or <hi>anſweares;</hi> for it is ſufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb facs="tcp:489:4"/>
if for the confirming of my opinion I haue either brought at the leaſt wiſe <hi>probable reaſons,</hi> or elſe haue giuen only a <hi>probable anſweare</hi> to the reaſons of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or of any other who hath taken vpon him his defence: for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie</hi> of one thing, and <hi>certaintie</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie can not ſtand together, neither can there be alleadged any <hi>probable anſweare</hi> to a reaſon which is <hi>truely demonſtratiue</hi> and <hi>inuincible.</hi> But <hi>he that imagineth to ouerthrow my</hi> Apologie for the right of Princes <hi>only with plauſible, and probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, is both himſelfe groſly deceiued, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very eaſily deceiue his Reader; for he that will take vpon him to demonſtrate his opinion to be</hi> certaine, <hi>&amp; to be</hi> beleeued as a point of faith, <hi>and to</hi> conuince <hi>the contrarie to be</hi> heretical, <hi>&amp; which can not</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be defended <hi>by any true Catholike, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie produce either</hi> vnanſwerable authorities, <hi>or</hi> inuincible reaſons, <hi>and to which no</hi> probable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare <hi>can be giuen.</hi> And this is the true ſtate of the queſtion concerning the <hi>Popes Holineſſe</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to depoſe Princes. Now what profit this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſputing bringeth to Princes, I haue ſhewed in the end of my <hi>Apologie</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">See alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath cap. 3. ſec. 2. nu. 4.</note>, and this benefit Subiects doe reape thereby, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the knowledge of the truth in a matter of ſo great importance, as is to diſcerne a <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> doctrine from <hi>hereticall,</hi> they ſhall moſt cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, that for the defending of opinions, which are onely <hi>probable,</hi> they are not bound to caſt away there whole temporall eſtate, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the high diſpleaſure of their Prince, and to
<pb facs="tcp:489:4"/>
expoſe their whole poſterity to danger of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall beggerie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither is the ſtate of this controuerſie concerning the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> which doth greatly depend vpon the former queſtion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Princes, vnlike to the ſtate of it. For they that are of opinion that the <hi>Oath</hi> may lawfullie be taken, are for this cauſe moued thereunto, for that they are perſwaded, that by the Law of God they are bound to obey the command of their lawfull Prince, ſo long as it doth not apppeare, that he commandeth them any vnlawfull thing, or which exceedeth his authority to command. And therefore theſe men thinke it to be ſufficient for them, if they doe but make <hi>a probable anſwere</hi> to all the arguments which are drawne from the authority of holy <hi>Scriptures, Councells, Canons</hi> of holy Church, your <hi>Holineſſe Breues,</hi> and from Theologicall reaſons, or any other proofs, which do ſeeme cleerely to demonſtrate, that the whole Oath, or any part thereof is repugnant to faith or ſaluation, or doth exceede his <hi>Maieſties</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to commaund. But they that will take vpon them to conuince that <hi>this Oath</hi> cannot bee taken by any man with a <hi>probable,</hi> and conſequently <hi>ſafe conſcience,</hi> it is not enough for them to bring only either <hi>probable reaſons,</hi> or <hi>probable authorities,</hi> but they muſt alſo bring <hi>ſuch demonſtratiue,</hi> and <hi>inuincible arguments,</hi> to which no <hi>probable anſwere</hi> can be giuen. But this they will neuer be able to doe, for it is an eaſie matter to cite ſome texts of holy Scripture, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, feede my
<pb facs="tcp:489:5"/>
ſheepe, If you haue Secular iudgements, &amp;c.</hi> alſo ſome <hi>Generall Councells,</hi> that of <hi>Laterane,</hi> that of <hi>Lyons;</hi> and that of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſome <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Holy Church, Nos ſanctorum, Iuratos, Abſolutos,</hi> and three <hi>Breues</hi> of your <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> for the confirming of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; But that this is the true meaning of the <hi>Scripture</hi> which they pretend, that this is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concluded from the <hi>Councells, Canons,</hi> and your <hi>Holineſſe Breues,</hi> which they would haue, I doe not ſay, <hi>onely probably to perſwade,</hi> but by a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue argument</hi> to which no <hi>probable anſwer</hi> can bee giuen <hi>euidently</hi> to <hi>conuince</hi> this truely is a thing of too too great difficulty. And this is the reaſon, <hi>moſt Holy Father,</hi> which maketh me to be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident againſt ſuch learned Aduerſaries. For I am confident in the cauſe, which I am certainly perſwaded to be moſt iuſt, and not in my owne learning which I acknowledge to be but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. For it is ſufficient for me to bring reaſons, or anſweres, which at the leaſt are <hi>probable,</hi> which in a <hi>diſputable matter</hi> is not very hard to do; but my aduerſaries, vnleſſe they bring <hi>demonſtratiue argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and which <hi>euidently doe conuince,</hi> and doe <hi>cleerelie</hi> confute my anſweres as altogether <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,</hi> they labour all in vaine, and they will at length perceiue, that they do not fight againſt that doctrine, which I haue taught, but againſt that, which they themſelues haue faigned.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Secondly,</hi> the manner, which my aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue obſerued in confuting my Doctrine, &amp; confirming their own, is too too exorbitant. For to that which hitherto I haue written, two <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:489:5"/>
of Diuinity haue made an anſwere, to wit, <hi>Edward Weston,</hi> and <hi>Adolphus Schulckenius;</hi> (if <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> and not Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as D. <hi>Weston</hi> hath conſtantly auerred to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, be the principall Author of that booke;) but both of them ſo vnſoundly, guilefully, bitterlie, that they doe plainely ſhew, that they rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire by impoſing vpon mee that which I neuer ſaide, and by reproachfull ſpeeches to diſgrace my perſon, then by ſolide reaſons, &amp; arguments to confute my doctrine, &amp; to defend their owne. For eyther they charge mee with thoſe things which I neuer wrote, nor imagined; or thoſe things which I haue written, they doe in ſuch manner depraue, that they doe altogether miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiue the true meaning of them, and ſo they do not impugne, what I haue affirmed, but what themſelues haue inuented, or elſe they doe ſo couldly confirme their owne opinion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with their clamours they fill the eares of the vnlearned, yet the learned may plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that they are cleane ouercome, and that they proſecute their cauſe not ſo much by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as by reproachfull ſpeeches; and laſtlie they would willingly that their owne vncertain inferences out of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Councells,</hi> which we haue heeretofore fully ſatiſfied, ſhould be accounted infallible poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of faith; al which partly I haue beneath briefly inſinuated, leſt that I ſhould be more troubleſome to <hi>your Holineſſe,</hi> then a ſupplicatorie letter doth require, partly I will ſhew heereafter, God willing, more at large.
<pb facs="tcp:489:6"/>
Wherefore if <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> relying vpon the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and conſcience of theſe men, or of others of greater place, and dignity, and giuing credit to their falſe informations, ſhould condemne my writings as <hi>hereticall,</hi> or <hi>erroneous,</hi> as <hi>Doctor We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and <hi>Doctor Schulckenius,</hi> or if <hi>D. Weſton</hi> bee to bee beleeued, Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, haue falſly and iniuriouſly laide to my charge, what great wrong <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> ſhould doe me, &amp; what occaſion of no ſmall ſcandall you ſhould giue to the aduerſaries of the Catholike Church, I remit to the iudgement both of <hi>your Holineſſe,</hi> &amp; alſo of the whole Chriſtian world: Neither is it vnknowne to <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> how that certaine bookes, which if neede ſhall require, I wil heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after name, where ſome few yeares ſince, by a particular decree of the <hi>See Apostolicke,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Inquiſition</hi> through the euill information, and importunity of ſome certain men, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as erroneous, and if I doe not forget, as <hi>flat hereticall,</hi> who neuertheleſſe did afterwards, the matter being better examined, recall the former ſentence by a new decree, which did not contain ſo ſeuere a cenſure.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now what manner they haue held in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning this <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hitherto, I wil with as much breuity, as may be, ſincerely declare vnto <hi>your Holineſſe.</hi> It is well knowne, and publicke to the whole Chriſtian world, and which I cannot but with greefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe, how that horrible, and infamous conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of the Powder-Treaſon, plotted by certaine
<pb facs="tcp:489:6"/>
Catholickes vpon a prepoſterous zeale to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the Catholike religion, intending to blow vp with Gunpowder the whole houſe of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> together with the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> moſt excellent <hi>Maiesties,</hi> their Royal iſſue, &amp; the three States of the Realme, &amp; innumerable other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of euery ſtate, and condition, was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall occaſion of deuiſing &amp; enacting this <hi>Oath of Allegiance.</hi> For in the next <hi>Seſsion</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> after this deteſtable conſpiracie was but newly diſcouered, it was thought conuenient by all the States of this kingdome to frame the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and to ordaine, that it ſhould bee tendred to all ſorts of Catholickes vnder moſt greeuous puniſhments to all them who did refuſe it, thinking this to bee a moſt fit meanes for the better diſcouering heereafter of ſuch like traitors, and preſeruing of his Maieſtie from ſuch like future conſpiracies. The Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now enacted there was a great, and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation among Prieſts what Catholikes ought to do in this caſe. At the laſt <hi>Maſter George Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> beeing then <hi>Arch-Presbyter</hi> of the Engliſh Prieſts was reſolued to be of this opinion (which the greater part of Prieſts, who came then to London to know what was to be done in this ſo difficult a matter, did alſo follow) that this <hi>Oath,</hi> according to the plaine and common vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the words, might with a ſafe conſcience be taken by any Catholike. But this reſolution of <hi>Maſter Arch-Prieſt</hi> was nothing pleaſing to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ieſuites, and ſome other very few Prieſts in
<pb facs="tcp:489:7"/>
compariſon of the reſt. And from hence all this ſturre and controuerſie concerning the taking of this Oath did firſt ariſe. For thoſe Ieſuites did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently oppoſe themſelues againſt <hi>Maſter Arch-Prieſt,</hi> and did conſtantly affirme that they would reuerſe whatſoeuer had bene concluded by him, &amp; that they would procure a <hi>Breue</hi> from <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> to command all Catholikes not to take the <hi>Oath.</hi> Which truely with very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition according to their promiſe they did performe. For, although a certaine <hi>Prieſt</hi> not of the meaner ſort did preſently vpon <hi>Maſter Arch-Priests</hi> reſolution with all the ſpeede hee might write to <hi>Maſter Nicholas Fitzherbert</hi> beeing then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and did ſincerely relate vnto him how al things had paſt, earneſtly requeſting him, that either by himſelfe or by meanes of ſome <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi> hee would effectually deale with <hi>your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that you would not bee perſwaded to ſend hither at this time, and things ſtanding as they doe, any <hi>Breues</hi> to forbid the taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> leſt that otherwiſe your authority, as well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall to depoſe Princes, as ſpirituall to define infallibly without a <hi>Generall Councell, were more ſtrongly called in queſtion by Catholikes,</hi> then euer heeretofore: (For at that time <hi>Maſter Blackwell</hi> did onely intend to deny the lawfull executing of your power to depoſe Princes, things ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heere as they doe, and not the aforeſaid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall, or temporall power it ſelfe) yet this anſwer he receiued from <hi>Maſter Fitzherbert,</hi> that theſe letters, although they came to his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
<pb facs="tcp:489:7"/>
in a very ſhort time, yet they came too late, for that it was determined at <hi>Rome,</hi> that your <hi>Breues</hi> ſhould preſently bee ſent hither to forbid the <hi>Oath.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Father Parſons</hi> fearing leaſt our Engliſh Catholikes would be drawne away by the authority of <hi>Maſter Arch-Prieſt,</hi> and of the other <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who followed his opinion, ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly hither his letters (the true copie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will beneath <hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſet downe) which were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forewarnings of your future <hi>Breues,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gaue Engliſh Catholikes to vnderſtand, that there was at <hi>Rome</hi> a conſultation of ſeuen, or eight of the learnedſt Diuines that could be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and all were of opinion, that this <hi>Oath</hi> vnder this forme of words could not bee taken by any man without denying the Catholike faith, for that the <hi>Popes</hi> authority in chaſtizing <hi>Princes</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a iuſt cauſe is <hi>de fide,</hi> and moreouer that your <hi>Holineſſe</hi> gaue the like anſwer to the ſame <hi>Father Parſons</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Maſter Thomas Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> But becauſe very many Catholikes with vs (as will appeare by this diſputation) do not wel perceiue from whence any good inference can be made, that your authority to chaſtiſe <hi>Princes</hi> in generall is in this <hi>Oath</hi> denyed, they would gladly concerning this point bee more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>your Holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 Not long after this letter of <hi>Father Parſons, your Holineſſe</hi> ſent hither your firſt <hi>Breue,</hi> wherein you expreſly declared, <hi>that this Oath, cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be taken by any man, for that it containeth many things which are cleerely repugnant to faith, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:489:8"/>
Some few months after it hapned that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Blackwel</hi> the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi> was apprehended, &amp; being brought before the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> he took the <hi>Oath</hi> being tendered him; whom Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> by priuate letters (about which time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo your ſecond <hi>Breue</hi> came hither) did ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, as though he had abiuted <hi>your Holineſſe ſpirituall primacie:</hi> But <hi>Maſter Blackwell</hi> by other letters (which by chance came into the hands of his <hi>Maieſties</hi> priuie <hi>Counſell,</hi> and which were an occaſion that hee did more cleerely explane his opinion concerning<note n="d" place="margin">For hee was very vnwilling for feare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring your holineſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to declare ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes.</note> al the particular clauſes of the <hi>Oath</hi>) did returne an anſwere to Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Againſt your <hi>Holineſſe</hi> his <hi>Breues,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines letters,</hi> the <hi>Kings Maieſtie,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealing at the firſt his name, did write an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> in defence of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance.</hi> To which <hi>Apologie Father Parſons</hi> in Engliſh, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine, Iacobus Gretzer, Leonard Coquaeus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Capellus, Martinus Becanus</hi> &amp; diuers others did anſwere in Latine: But all of them did ſo ſlenderly handle the queſtion of the <hi>Oath,</hi> which was the principall controuerſie, that the Engliſh Catholickes, who did before thinke the <hi>Oath</hi> to be lawfull, were therby more confirmed in their opinion, and the reſt, who fauoured the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> did not a little bluſh to ſee a matter of ſo great importance ſo weakely handled. For theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, otherwiſe doubtleſſe moſt learned, doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to proue, that in this <hi>Oath</hi> is plainely deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Popes Holineſse ſpiritual primacie,</hi> his power to excommunicate, and to bind and looſe, which
<pb facs="tcp:489:8"/>
neuertheleſſe the defenders of the <hi>Oath,</hi> as will appeare beneath, doth thinke to ſhew ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be falſe. Neither is there ſcarce any <hi>(learned)</hi> Prieſt with vs, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> only excepted, &amp; thoſe not all, who is of opinion, that there is any thing contained in this <hi>Oath,</hi> which is cleerely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to faith, as <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> in your <hi>Breues</hi> hath declared, and therefore neither dare they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely defend the ſame, but leaſt that they ſhould ſeeme to bee wholly diſcomfited, ſome of them fly to certain other arguments of leſſer moment, which in their due places I will rehearſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon betwixt a certaine <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> who was then priſoner in the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and ſome other Prieſts, who at the ſame time were priſoners in <hi>Newgate,</hi> (yet all of them very vehement againſt the <hi>Oath</hi>) there was by intercourſe of letters a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention concerning this matter; But at the laſt theſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who affirmed that the oath neither contained in it any hereſie, or error, compelled the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> by force of diſputation partly to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and partly to interpret his opinion in a milder ſort.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And this is the reaſon <hi>(moſt holy Father)</hi> why very few Lay-Catholikes of any name, or worth with vs doe refuſe to take the <hi>oath,</hi> being tendered them by the Magiſtrate. For while they aduiſedly call to remembrance, that this <hi>oath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was by <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> declared to be cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to faith, and ſaluation, might with a probable, and conſequently with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be taken by any Catholike, by reaſon of the

Apoſtolicall letters, which either are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vpon falſe information, or grounded onely vpon a probable opinion.

And therefore they both thinke themſelues to be more hardly dealt with all, that hauing ſo long time endured ſo great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, there ſhould be now ſo heauie a burden laid vpon them by him, from whom they rather expected to haue receiued ſome comfort, as that they ſhould be enforced, to the vtter ruine of their whole poſteritie, beſides the perpetuall loſſe of their owne goods and libertie, and alſo, which is moſt grieuous to them, with manifeſt danger to incurre the high diſpleaſure of their Prince, being otherwiſe very mercifull, to defend opinions which only are probable, &amp; may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

And doubtleſſe if <hi>your Holineſſe</hi> were but rightly informed, how ſcandalouſly, and vnſincerely ſome of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here with vs, who would gladly in outward ſhew be accounted vehement impugners of the <hi>Oath,</hi> carrie themſelues in hugger mugger, of whom, if it ſhall be neceſſarie, I will hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>your Holineſſe,</hi> truly I cannot tell, whether the tender bowels of your fatherly charitie would rather bee moued to take compaſſion of thoſe Catholikes, who without diſſimulation do defend the <hi>Oath</hi> for cauſes which they thinke to be reaſonable, or to take diſpleaſure againſt their Aduerſaries.</p>

But in this hee doth me exceeding great wrong, (and thereof I call God to bee a witnes, and reuenger againſt him) in ſhamefull affirming, that I conſpired to take away his life. <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>thou beginneſt a tragedie againſt me which ſhould haue gloriouſly ended with my blood, if it had ſucceeded according to thy deſire.</hi> God is my witnes, that this is moſt falſe, which he chargeth me withall. For I neuer, I call the ſame God to witnes, did euen in thought plot any thing againſt the perſon of this man, neither did I euer wiſh to him any thing worſe then to my ſelfe. That alſo which he ſaith, <hi>that I vpon ſpleene againſt the Ieſuites, wrote my Apologie for the rightfull power of Princes, and that hee by priuate letters did admoniſh me of my impietie, and hereſie,</hi> is moſt vntrue; For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon any ſpleen againſt the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> whoſe Order I doe reuerence with all dutifull reſpect, whom this <hi>Doctor</hi> hauing now with the aire changed alſo his mind, doth in his book egregiouſly flatter, I was moued to write my <hi>apology;</hi> This only did very much diſlike me, and which at the firſt cauſed me to write, that ſome of theſe Religious men did ſo ſtifly cleaue to their owne opinions, that they would needs haue them to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Catholickes to the exceeding ſcandall of the Church, and to the great temporall preiudice of our
<pb facs="tcp:489:18"/>
Engliſh Catholickes. Neither did this <hi>Doctor</hi> ſend his letters to me, or imagined that they ſhould come to my hands, but by chance by meanes of a friend of mine I came to a ſight of them. And verily, if both in the Weſterne, and Northerne parts of this Land it had not been reported by many, that a <hi>Doctor</hi> of Diuinitie had excellently confuted my <hi>Apologie,</hi> and ſhewed moſt cleerely, that many hereticall propoſitions were, forſooth, therein contained, I would neuer haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſuch an idle Pamphlet. But ſeeing that hee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and treacherouſly accuſing me of <hi>hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Paganiſme</hi> did firſt aſſault me, the moſt iuſt law of nature giueth me leaue to haue care of my credit and good name, in a matter of ſuch moment as is the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into hereſie, and to free my ſelfe by lawfull meanes from ſuch a foule imputation. And if he in aſſaulting me hath by the blameleſſe defending of my innocencie receiued any ſcarre, let him not attribute the ſame to my iuſt defence, but to his wrongfull ſetting vpon me, who hath prepared for himſelfe a pitfall, wherein bee might be caught. I am a <hi>Catholicke,</hi> and a child of the <hi>Catholicke Romane Church;</hi> and if any man of what degree ſoeuer he be, ſhall wrongfully accuſe me of hereſie, let him know aſſuredly, that by the aſsiſtance of almightie God, I will by all thoſe meanes, which <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> hath granted to innocent men to defend themſelues, to the vttermoſt of my power cleere my ſelfe of thoſe ſlanders, vntill the <hi>Church</hi> being perfectly informed of my opinion, ſhall in plaine, and particular words, (for no man can recall errours, vnleſſe he know particularly what they be) condemne the ſame.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:489:18"/>9. <hi>The third</hi> thing, which I would admoniſh thee of <hi>(courteous Reader)</hi> is, that when this preſent <hi>Diſputation</hi> was in the Preſſe, I had a ſight of the <hi>Apologeticall Diſputation</hi> of <hi>Leonard Leſſius,</hi> wherein I found an obiection alleaged by him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the <hi>Oath,</hi> which his <hi>Engliſh Recapitulator</hi> (fearing perchance that it would not be pleaſing to our Engliſh Catholickes) did make no mention thereof, whereas of the reſt of <hi>Leſſius</hi> his arguments againſt the ſaid <hi>Oath,</hi> he doth not ſo much make an <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Recapitulation,</hi> but rather relate them word by word.

               <hi>12. The fourth</hi> and laſt thing, whereof I would admoniſh thee, is, that when the printing of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was almoſt fully finiſhed, there was ſent vnto me an Engliſh booke printed but lately, and entituled, <hi>A Supplement to the diſcourſe of</hi> Maſter Doctor Barlowes <hi>Anſwere, &amp;c. compoſed by F.

And this is the ſumme and ſubſtance of his whole Diſcourſe. Firſt of all he ſuppoſeth that in this <hi>Oath</hi> is denyed the Popes power not only to depoſe, but alſo to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Princes, if they ſhall deſerue it, and the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſoules ſhall neceſſarily require it. From whence he afterwards<note n="u" place="margin">Pag. 66. nu. 117.</note> concludeth, <hi>that although the Oath doth not expreſly affirme, the</hi> Kings Maieſtie <hi>to bee the ſupreme head of the Engliſh Church,
<pb facs="tcp:489:20"/>
nor in plaine words denie the</hi> Pope <hi>ſo to be; yet it ſuppoſeth, and implyeth both the one, and the other; and thereupon denyeth the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to excommunicate, and depoſe a temporall Prince. And howſoeuer the matter bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe coloured, it is euident enough, that the true reaſon, for which the ſaid authoritie of the</hi> Pope <hi>is impugned in the Oath, is no other, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the</hi> Kings Maieſtie <hi>is held to be no way ſubiect to the</hi> Pope, <hi>yea and to bee himſelfe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of the Church of God in England.</hi> This being ſuppoſed, this Author endeuoureth to proue the <hi>Oath</hi> to bee repugnant to the law of God, of nature, of Nations, to the Ciuill, and Canonicall law.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <hi>13.</hi> Out of the old Teſtament hee produceth that ſaying of Deuteron. <hi>17.

Out of the ciuill law he bringeth many Conſtitutions of <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and the Statute lawes alſo of this Kingdome to proue the Popes Primacie in ſpirituals.

For out of this principle we might alſo argue in this manner: <hi>The acceſſorie followeth the principall, therefore he that is Lord of all horſes, muſt bee Lord of all bridles: The Pope hath power ouer the ſoules of Kings, therefore alſo ouer their liues.</hi> Let this <hi>Author</hi> explaine vnto vs, what the Lawyers do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by this word <hi>(acceſſorie,)</hi> and what by this word <hi>(principall)</hi> in this their vulgar <hi>maxime,</hi> which hath many limitations, and by diuers learned men, is diuerſly vnderſtood; in the meane time we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his conſequence.

               <note n="a" place="margin">In his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeticall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation pag. 201.</note> doth make: <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Kings, therefore he hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; becauſe hee that can puniſh with a

Fourthly,</hi> whoſoeuer will attentiuely read the diſcourſe of this Author, will moſt cleerely perceiue, that hee doth not forcibly proue any other thing from the law of God, or nature, then that the temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is in ſpirituals, and in temporals, as they become ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the Church to command, but not to puniſh <hi>by way of coercion</hi>

was offended not only becauſe <hi>Ozias</hi> was not caſt out of the City, but alſo becauſe he was ſuffered ſtill to reigne, is alſo contrary to Saint <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> words, which haue bin related by this Author.

               <hi>which we demanded in the beginning, what is the cauſe, that ſeeing in prophecies all are wont to ſet downe the time, wherein the Kings did reigne, this</hi> Prophet Eſay <hi>omitting that nameth the time, wherein</hi> OZias <hi>died, ſpeaking in this manner,</hi> And it came to paſſe in the yeare wherein King <hi>Ozias</hi> dyed. <hi>And yet hee might haue expreſſed the time of the King, as all prophets vſually did. But he did not ſo: For what cauſe did he not ſo? It was an ancient cuſtome to caſt a leprous out of the City, to the end that thoſe who liued in the City might be the better, and that the leprous himſelfe ſhould not preſent to men, prone to giue reprochfull ſpeeches an occaſion of ſcoffing and deriſion: but that he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the city might haue ſolitarines to be in ſteed of a vaile, or couer, againſt the reproch of calamitie. And this ought this King to haue ſuffered after his leproſie, but he did not ſuffer it, thoſe that were in the City reuerencing him for his Soueraigntie: but hee remained at his houſe priuately. This prouoked God to wrath, this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the prophecie, and which came to paſſe in the time of</hi> Hely <hi>the word of God was precious, neither was there any commanding viſion.</hi> Thus Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whereby it is manifeſt, that Saint
<pb facs="tcp:489:28"/>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth not affirme, that God was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Ozias</hi> was thruſt out of his Kingdome, but only that he was not thruſt out of the City, according as the law in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> did ordaine.</p>
            <p n="30">
               <hi>30.</hi> Wherefore the meaning of thoſe former words of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome, he ſate in his throne brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againe the law of God,</hi> is cleere by theſe later which I did now relate. For as before he being no Prieſt tranſgreſſed by preſuming to offer incenſe, ſo now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he being leprous tranſgreſſeth by preſuming to remaine in the City, which the law did forbid. Alſo this Author may perchance vſe ſome cunning in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thoſe words of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in ſolio legem Dei rurſum tranſgrediens, He ſate ſtill in this throne breaking againe the law of God,</hi> as though <hi>Ozias</hi> had offended againe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill in his throne, or continuing to be King; wherefore this word <hi>ſtill</hi> may be equiuocall, and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe put by this <hi>Author</hi> to ſignifie the ſenſe aforeſaid, whereas the words of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> are only, <hi>He ſate in this throne breaking againe the law of God;</hi> not for that he ſate in his throne, or which is all one, kept ſtill his Royall dignitie, although his ſonne <hi>Ioa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>32.</hi> Among other ſufficient anſweres, which I gaue to this argument, I denyed the conſequence; to wit, that although the Prieſts of the old Teſtament had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to depriue a King, being infected with leproſie, of the adminiſtration of his Kingdome, ſo long as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a leper, (for that I doe not thinke it to be ſcarce probable that they had authoritie to depriue him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his Regall authority,) neuertheleſſe it doth not therefore follow, that the Prieſts of the new law haue the like authority. My reaſon was, for that the Prieſts of the old Teſtament had by the ſpeciall law of God au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority granted to iudge and determine when any man was infected with leproſie, and withall there was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar puniſhment appointed by the law againſt thoſe who were infected with leproſie, to wit, that they ſhould liue <hi>extra caſtra out of the campe,</hi> that is, a part from the reſt, (for then the Iſralites were as an armie of men marching forwards day by day, in the deſert
<pb facs="tcp:489:29"/>
For if it ſhould be ſo, that a King liuing out of the City, could not poſsibly gouerne his Kingdome, and in the old Teſtament Kings being infected with leproſie were by the law of God compelled to liue out of the City, it followeth neceſſarily, that God gaue leaue to the Prieſts or to the people to depriue a leprous King, or to declare him depriued of the gouernment of his Kingdome, ſo long as he remained a leper: But the Prieſts in the new Teſtament haue doubtleſſe authority giuen them by Chriſt to iudge, determine and decide, what is hereſie, and who is infected therewith, and alſo to puniſh with Excommunication and other Eccleſiaſticall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments any one who is infected with hereſie, which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Excommunication (which as <hi>Suarez</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Tom. 5. diſp. 1. ſec. 4.</note> defineth it, <hi>is an Eccleſiaſticall Cenſure, whereby one is depriued of the Eccleſiaſtical communion of the faithfull)</hi> was figured by that ſeparation of the leper from the company of thoſe who were in the campe: yet becauſe the depriuing a King of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his Kingdome doth not by the law of God follow the ſentence of Excommunication, which by the law of God only depriueth of Eccleſiaſticall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the old Teſtament it did follow the liuing of a King out of the City, and a part from the reſt of the people, as our Aduerſaries doe ſuppoſe, this example of King <hi>Ozias</hi> is of little worth to proue the <hi>Popes</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to depoſe hereticall Princes.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Alſo I doe ſweare from my heart, that notwithſtanding any declaration or ſentence of Excommunication or depriuation made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, or by any Authoritie deriued or pretended to be deriued from him or his Sea againſt the ſaid King, his Heires or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, or any abſolution of the ſaid Subiects from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I will beare faith and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power againſt all Conſpiracies and attempts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, which ſhall bee made againſt his or their Perſons, their Crowne and dignitie, by reaſon or colour of any ſuch ſentence or declaration or otherwiſe, and will doe my beſt endeauour to diſcloſe and make knowne vnto his Maieſtie, his Heires and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, all Treaſons and Traiterous Conſpiracies, which I ſhall

know or heare of to be againſt him or any of them. <hi>pag.</hi> 52.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

From which neceſſitie proceeded the ſcience of the Ciuill law; whoſe true end is to deliuer the true ſenſe, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of humane lawes; and which without all doubt is greatly to be regarded, for that in euery art

                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. AS concerning the words, we ſay, that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humane law the propertie of the words, that is, the proper ſignification of them is firſt of all to be regarded, for from it the true interpretation of the law is chiefly to be gathered, and which, if there be no other impediment, is alwaies to be preferred, as may be deduced by many texts of the Canon<note n="e" place="margin">Extra <hi>de tranſlat. Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi</hi> cap. 2. &amp; in cap. <hi>ad audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> de deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</note>, and Ciuill law<note n="f" place="margin">Leg. <hi>Non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ff. <hi>de legat.</hi> 3. leg 1. §. <hi>ſi is qui nauem</hi> ff. de Exercitoria actione: &amp; in leg <hi>proſpexit</hi> ff. qui, &amp; à qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note>. And the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe in common ſpeech words are to be taken in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and vſuall meaning, vnleſſe by ſome circumſtance the contrarie may be gathered, therefore much more this is to be obſerued in lawes, which ought to be cleere, and not expoſed to circumuentions, and falſe interpretations: for otherwiſe nothing could bee certaine in lawes, neither could mens actions be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and directed by them, for that euery one might according to his pleaſure wreſt them to improper ſenſes. And in regard of this rule the ancient Fathers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:489:33"/>
and Diuines doe teach, that the words of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which doe deliuer any doctrine of faith, or precepts of manners, are to be taken in their proper ſenſe, vnleſſe by circumſtances, or otherwiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie may neceſſarily be gathered.</q>

                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. But if it chance, that any word of the law hath together many proper, and vſuall ſignifications, then we muſt vſe that rule, which in all ambiguous, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall ſpeeches is wont prudently to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: to wit, that the matter of the law, with other circumſtances, be diligently conſidered, for by them the meaning of the words will eaſily be determined. And eſpecially wee muſt conſider the beginning of the law, and with it to ioyne the reſt which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for to the beginning, if there be no obſtacle all which followeth, is to be applied. For in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euery conſtitution the finall cauſe, and which doth chiefly moue the Law-maker, is vſually contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therfore, according to the common doctrine of the Lawyers, that moſt of all is to bee regarded to vnderſtand the meaning of the law. Wherefore it is neceſſarie, that euery man, before hee deliuer his iudgement, how any equiuocall word of the law is to be vnderſtood, to peruſe diligently the whole law from the beginning to the end, according to that principle of the Ciuill law, <hi>Inciuile eſt,</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Leg. <hi>Inciuile</hi> ff. de leg.</note> &amp;c. <hi>It is an vnciuill part to giue his iudgement, or anſwere concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any one particular clauſe of the law, vnleſſe the whole law be firſt peruſed.</hi> Therefore by the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and conſequents, together with the matter, and other circumſtances, the equiuocall ſignification of any word is to be determined. But if the words of the law ſhould be ſo equiuocall, that neither by the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, nor conſequents, nor by the matter, or reaſon of the law, the determinate ſenſe of the law could be knowne, then it were no law, becauſe not only it were not cleere, but alſo it ſhould not ſufficiently expreſſe

Wherefore it is true, that men doe iudge of the mind of the ſpeaker by his words, and that a law is not made by the internall will, vnleſſe it be in the law it ſelfe ſufficiently expreſſed; for that a law, being a rule of humane actions, hauing force to binde, (wherein it differeth from a councell, or any other admonition, which hath not force to binde,) it muſt by words ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſſed in the lawe bee propounded to them, whom it intendeth to binde.

But that reaſon; which is not expreſſed in the law, but inuented by Expoſitors, although it may ſomewhat auaile to finde out the will of the Law-maker, yet it is not a certaine token, but only a probable conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; both becauſe the reaſon is not alwaies cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but controuerted among Doctors, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:489:37"/>
it is much more vncertaine, whether that was the reaſon, which moued the Law-maker, ſeeing that there may be other reaſons, for which he might bee moued, and conſequently it is vncertaine, to what reaſon the true meaning of the law is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</q>
Many other obſeruations, which now to rehearſe would be ouer tedious, are ſet downe by Doctors, to know how by a doctrinall interpretation lawes may ſometimes be extended, ſomtimes reſtrained, but theſe, which wee haue taken out of <hi>Suarez</hi> almoſt word for word, will giue no ſmall light to the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the true meaning of the oath, whereof we now doe treate.</p>

                     <note n="a" place="margin">In Comment. Exeget. cap. 6. pag. 103.</note> a famous Diuine of the Societie of Ieſus, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this clauſe <hi>[our Soueraigne Lord]</hi> obiect in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoeuer affirmeth that King Iames, and not the Pope is ſupreme head of the Chriſtians in great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie euen in Eccleſiaſticall, and ſpirituall matters; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the Catholique faith; But hee, that taketh the oath preſcribed by King Iames, affirmeth that King Iames and not the Pope is ſupreme head of great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:489:38"/>
euen in ſpirituals, therefore hee denieth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith. The Minor I proue: becauſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the oath hee profeſſeth, teſtifieth, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſwearing in his conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before God, and the world, that King Iames is his Soueraigne Lord, but according to the commmon vſe, and practiſe of England, this Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lordſhip, or Supreme dominion is referred not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Supreme ciuill, but alſo to the ſpirituall, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall; for it is treaſon to deny or not to grant to the King this ſpirituall Supremacie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection it is anſwered by denying the Minor propoſition. For firſt of all, although his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subiects, according to the preſent lawes of this kingdome, are ſometimes vnder grieuous puniſhments compelled to ſweare, that our moſt Noble Prince King Iames is Supreme Gouernour of this Kingdome as wel in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, as in temporall, neuertheleſſe they are not compelled to acknowledge the aforeſaid Kings Supremacie, by vertue of his oath of Allegiance, whereof now we treate, but by vertue of another oath, commonly called, <hi>the oath of Supremacie.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although this word <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Dominus,</hi> may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in general as well a ſpiritual, as a temporal <hi>Lord,</hi> yet when it is ſpoken of a temporall <hi>Lord,</hi> and its an oath of temporall Allegiance, it ought in common ſpeech, and vnderſtanding, to which in this oath we are tyed, to be limited by the matter, which is handled, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances annexed, according to the rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 1. ſect. 2.</note> related, to ſignifie only a temporall <hi>Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Lord</hi> in temporall affaires.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Beſides, if wee muſt needes ſcan ſo ſtrictly euery word of the oath, firſt, in the oath it ſelfe of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whereon <hi>Gretzer</hi> groundeth his obiection, theſe words [<hi>Soueraigne Lord</hi> are not ſo much as named, but only <hi>[Supreme Gouernour]</hi> that hereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, what a ſeuere Cenſour <hi>Gretzer</hi> is, to condemne ſo raſhly, and vpon ſo weake a ground, for theſe words
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:489:38"/>
forſooth <hi>[our Soueraigne Lord]</hi> this oath of Allegiance, as containing a manifeſt deniall of the Catholique faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Secondly, ſith that <hi>Gretzer</hi> will be ſo rigorous a Cenſour, that propoſition, which he ſuppoſeth to proue his Minor, is alſo falſe. For I doe not in this branch of the oath <hi>profeſſe, teſtifie, and declare ſwearing, that King Iames is our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> as <hi>Gretzer</hi> doth falſely affirme, for ſo <hi>Soueraigne Lord</hi> ſhould be the predicate, and not the ſubiect of the propoſition, whereas <hi>true, and lawfull King</hi> is the predicate, or, which is all one, is affirmed of <hi>our Soueraigne Lord King Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. True indeed it is, that in this branch of the oath, wee call King Iames <hi>our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> by which name all Kings, what Religion ſoeuer they profeſſe, are vſually called by their Subiects, yet, if wee will ſpeake ſtrictly, and in rigour, wee doe not in this branch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly affirme, or ſweare, as <hi>Gretzer</hi> faineth, that King Iames is <hi>our Soueraigne Lord</hi> (although we might tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lawfully ſweare the ſame:) but wee doe onely here affirme, and ſweare, that <hi>our Soueraigne Lord</hi> King Iames is lawfull, and rightfull King of this Kingdome. Now who ſeeth not, that betwixt bare calling, and ſwearing there is a great diſtinction? For Iewes, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, or Heretikes, who eſpecially are ſubiect to the Pope in temporals, will not be much afraid, if cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to call him <hi>their moſt holie Lord,</hi> becauſe this name, or title is giuen him by all men; but to profeſſe, affirme, and ſweare, that he is <hi>a moſt holy Lord,</hi> or, which is all one, that he is truly ſo called, they will perchance ſtand in ſome feare. As alſo thoſe, who ſo vehementlie impugne this oath, will not ſticke perchance to call it <hi>the oath of Allegiance,</hi> ſeeing that commonly it is ſo called, yet to profeſſe, teſtifie, and by oath affirme, that it is truly, and in very deede <hi>an oath of allegiance,</hi> as it is vſually called, without doubt they will not aduenture. Neither is this, which we now haue ſaid, for that cauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:489:39"/>
affirmed by vs, as though wee doe thinke it lawfull, to call King Iames <hi>our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> but not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge by oath, that he is <hi>our Soueraigne Lord;</hi> but only to ſhew how idly <hi>Gretzer</hi> from thoſe words, <hi>our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> doth take occaſion to impugne this oath, as repugnant to Catholique faith.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If perhaps <hi>Gretzer</hi> had dedicated this his <hi>Exegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Commentarie</hi> to King Iames, who now reigneth in great Britannie, (as hee hath conſecrated the ſame to his moſt holie mother, who now reigneth with Chriſt in heauen) he would greatly haue feared to haue called him <hi>moſt potent Lord,</hi> as he calleth him ſomtimes <hi>moſt potent King,</hi> leſt that he ſhould haue ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to bee a Lord in ſpirituals, ſeeing that this <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> of the K. of England, if we may giue credit to <hi>Gretzer, is according to the common vſe, and practiſe of England, to be referred not only to the ciuill, and temporall, but alſo to the ſpirituall, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Lordſhip, or Dominion.</hi> And wee alſo doe not a little meruaile, how <hi>Gretzer</hi> durſt aduenture to call the Kings Maieſtie ſo often in his booke <hi>King of great Britannie,</hi> ſith that betwixt <hi>a King,</hi> and <hi>a ſupreme Lord,</hi> or <hi>Gouernour, Gretzer</hi> can alleage no great diſtinction; and, according to <hi>Gretzer, this ſupreme gouernment, or Soueraigntie, is referred not only to the ciuill, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but alſo to the Eccleſiaſticall, and ſpirituall Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. But of a farre different opinion are <hi>Martinus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> and Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> both eminent Ieſuites, who, concerning theſe words, <hi>our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> are not ſo ſcrupulous. For <hi>Becanus</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:489:39"/>
who ſticketh, or maketh difficultie to acknowledge our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne to be true King, and rightfull Lord ouer all his Dominions; for that euery Engliſh Catholike will ſweare, and acknowledge moſt willingly all thoſe parts, and clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Oath, that doe any way appertaine to the Ciuill, and Temporall obedience due to his Maiestie, whom he acknowledgeth for his true, and lawfull King, and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ouer all his Dominions.</hi> Whereby it is apparant, that this violent expoſition, which <hi>Gretzer</hi> wreſteth from thoſe words, <hi>our Soueraigne Lord,</hi> is neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by <hi>Becanus,</hi> nor Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> nor by any other, that I haue either read, or heard of, either of our owne, or of any other nation.

                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:489:40"/>2. To this obiection, which <hi>Becanus,</hi> and Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> according to their principles but now related, muſt confeſſe, to bee but a meere Sophiſme, (ſeeing that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, <hi>it is certaine, that euery man may by oath acknowledge, King Iames to be true, and lawfull King of England,</hi> &amp;c.) it may bee anſwered two waies: Firſt, that, according to the common opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, euery man may lawfully, and without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of periurie, ſweare that thing to be true, which hee perſwadeth himſelfe to bee morally certaine, neither hath he any probable doubt of the contrary; although the thing, which he confirmeth by oath, be perchance in very deede not true: but of the true, and lawfull title of our moſt noble Prince King <hi>Iames</hi> to this kingdome, we are morally certaine, neither can wee haue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon, to moue vs to any neuer ſo ſmall a doubt to the contrary, eſpeciallie ſeeing that his true, and rightfull title to this kingdome hath been declared, and confirmed by the vniuerſall conſent of the whole kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſecond anſwere is, that the immediate obiect of this oath, or, which is all one, the thing immediatly ſworne, is not this propoſition, <hi>King Iames is true, and lawfull King of this kingdome,</hi> &amp;c. but this, <hi>I doe trulie, and ſincerely acknowledge, profeſſe, teſtifie, and declare in my conſcience, that King Iames is true, and lawfull King of this kingdome,</hi> &amp;c. but of this my vnfained, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere acknowlegement, profeſſion, teſtification, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration I am not onely morally, but alſo Phyſically certaine, and therefore no man can incurre any danger at all of periurie by taking this branch of the oath.

                  <p n="1">1. THis ſecond branch of the oath is that <hi>rocke of ſcandall,</hi> and <hi>ſtone of offence,</hi> whereat ſo many of this age, as well learned, as vnlearned doe vſually ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For certaine eminent writers of this age, to wit, <hi>Card. Bellarmine, Iacobus Gretzer, Leonard Leſſius, Martin Becanus,</hi> all Diuines of the Societie of Ieſus, and ſome others moued eſpecially with the authoritie of theſe men, who, to defend his Holineſſe Breues, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Engliſh Catholiques, haue taken vpon them to impugne this oath of Allegiance, doe chiefly relie vpon the Popes power to depoſe Princes, as a moſt ſure and firme foundation to proue euidently the ſaid oath to bee vnlawfull, and to containe many things,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:489:41"/>
which are flat contrary to faith and the health of ſoules, as his Holineſſe hath publikely, and in expreſſe words by his Breues declared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt therefore, and moſt principall obiection, which is commonly made againſt this ſecond branch, is framed by <hi>Martin Becanus</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">In Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſia Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana, cap. 3. q. 4 pag. 138.</note> in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No man can with a good conſcience take that oath, wherein is contained any propoſition, which he iudgeth to be cleerely falſe. But in the oath of Allegiance, which his Maieſtie hath propounded, there is contained a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Catholikes iudge to be cleerely falſe, therefore Catholikes cannot with a good conſcience take this oath. The Maior propoſition is euident, becauſe no man can with a good conſcience affirme any thing without an oath, which he iudgeth to be falſe, therefore much leſſe with an oath; for if a ſimple lie be not lawfull, much leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole difficultie therefore is to proue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor propoſition, which if it be once ſufficiently confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it will forthwith be euidently conuinced, that this oath cannot with a good conſcience be taken by any Catholike.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And firſt of all <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Leſſius,</hi> and which alſo <hi>Becanus</hi> doth inſinuate, doe openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is not only falſe, but alſo cleerely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Catholike faith, to affirme, that the Popes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe hath not authoritie to depoſe Princes; and this they imagine to haue demonſtrated by the teſtimonie of Scriptures, holy Fathers, Councels, holy Canons, and by moſt euident reaſons. But that <hi>Card. Bellarmines</hi> arguments are not conuincing, and demonſtratiue, I haue in another place<note n="b" place="margin">In my <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the Preface to my Apologet. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, nu. 33. &amp; ſeq.</note> abundantly proued, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it needleſſe to repeate them now againe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But <hi>Leſſius</hi> (beſides the authorities, and reaſons, brought by <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> to proue this doctrine of the Popes power to depoſe Princes, to be embraced as a receiued principle of ſaith, which I haue, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:489:41"/>
alreadie anſwered, and beſides certaine other his reaſons omitted by <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> which I alſo haue elſewhere<note n="c" place="margin">In the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Preface, nu. 52. &amp; ſeq.</note> alleaged, and ſatisfied) produceth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a chiefe ground, to confirme the aforeſaid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be certainly beleeued as a point of faith. Thus therefore he writeth:<note n="d" place="margin">In his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the Popes power, part. 2. ſect. 3. pag. 396.</note> 
                     <hi>But it is certainly to be held, that this doctrine</hi> [of depoſing] <hi>is not ambiguous, that one may lawfully hold either opinion, but altogether certaine, ſo that without iniurie to faith it cannot be denied. Which firſt I proue, for that theſe propoſitions are in expreſſe termes defined in a Romane Councell vnder Gregorie the ſeuenth,</hi> That the Pope may lawfully depoſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, That he may abſolue the ſubiects of wicked men from their allegiance. <hi>This Councell is to be ſeene in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphrius in the life of Gregorie the ſeuenth, and in Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in the yeare of our Lord</hi> 1076. <hi>But a definition made by the Pope with a Councell appertaineth to faith. Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I cannot in truth but greatly meruaile, that ſo ſingularly learned a man ſhould bring ſo weake, and vnlearned an argument to proue a matter of ſo great importance, as is the dethroaning of Soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as though it were lawfull for any man to play with the Crownes of Kings, and Emperours, Firſt therefore we denie, that the aforeſaid two propoſitions were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a Romane Councell vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we will not denie, but that they were indeede openly maintained by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. who was the firſt of all the Popes, as Hiſtoriographers do write,<note n="*" place="margin">See beneath cap. 6. ſect 3. nu. 16.</note> that depoſed the Romane Emperour.

                  </p>

Beſides, if thoſe ſentences were defined in the Romane Synode, how is it <hi>knowne</hi> to you, that they were defined, as propoſitions belonging to faith, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as probable aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But what kinde of definitions thoſe were, you might haue gathered by the eighth, ninth, tenth, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, and eighteenth ſentence. For the eighth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, <hi>that only the Pope can vſe the Imperiall armes:</hi> The ninth, <hi>That all Princes doe kiſſe only the Popes feete:</hi> The tenth, <hi>That the Popes name only is to be rehearſed in Churches:</hi> The eleuenth, <hi>That there is but one onely name in the world, to wit, the Popes:</hi> The eighteenth,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:489:42"/>
                     <hi>That the Pope, if he be canonically ordained, is by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of S. Peter vndoubtedly made a Saint, as witneſſeth Ennodius Biſhop of Pauia, to whom many holy Fathers do agree as is contained in the Decrees of bleſſed Pope Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus.</hi> Will you now auerre, that alſo theſe ſentences were defined in that Councell? Truly I doe not thinke you will. And if it moſt cleerely appeare euen in your owne iudgement, that theſe ſentences were not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Synode, how can it bee knowne to you, that the former two ſentences, rather then the reſt, were therein defined? Be carefull therefore, moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Leſſius,</hi> not to obiect againſt vs ſuch kinde of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, inuented firſt by your ſelfe, which in theſe times it had been farre better to haue omitted, then to haue vrged, for that they call either your learning, or ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in queſtion, and alſo doe rather weaken, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Popes power to define without a Generall Councell, which you doe ſo vehemently maintaine, that you will ſcarcely haue them to be accounted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, who are not herein of your opinion. Neither would I, for reuerence to the Sea Apoſtolike, haue made any mention of them at all, if you through incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate zeale, and being moued thereunto by no ſound and ſufficient reaſon, had not aduentured, to enforce ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous conſciences, and to thruſt by violence vpon the Chriſtian world doubtfull poſitions for certaine, and to coyne new articles of faith, to the great obloquie of ſo famous Diuines, who are not of your opinion, and alſo to the exceeding great temporall preiudice of all vs Engliſh Catholikes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But be it ſo, let vs grant you for diſputation ſake, which you cannot proue, that theſe briefe ſentences were defined in that Romane Councel not only as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable aſſertions, but alſo as moſt certaine poſitions of faith, yet wee may, without iniurie to the Catholike faith, with the Doctors of Paris, and many others, whom we will beneath<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 10. nu. 27</note> relate, denie your Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:489:43"/>
to wit, that the Popes definition only with a Prouinciall Councell, as that Romane Synod was, doth of neceſſitie make the doctrine, which it defineth, to be beleeued of all men as a point of faith, ſeeing that there are many Catholikes both of ſingular doctrine, and pietie, as I ſaid before, who doe conſtantly auerre, that the Pope defining without a Generall Councell may erre, and be deceiued. And I would willingly behold the ſhameleſſe forehead of that man, who would not bluſh to traduce ſo great, and ſo worthie men of ſuch eminent authoritie, learning, and pietie, as being halfe Catholikes, and enemies to the Sea Apoſtolike, or to diſtaine their honour with the reprochfull infamie of hereſie, errour, or temeritie.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Secondly, <hi>Becanus</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">In Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ.

What Catholike man dare preſume to ſweare this? Truly, it were all one, as if hee ſhould ſay, I ſweare in my conſcience before God, that concerning this point I know more then all others: No man, as I thinke, is ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. To this obiection of <hi>Becanus</hi> wee anſwere in like manner, that wee alſo doe no leſſe meruaile, that a man ſo excellently learned (to impugne the oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance) ſhould ſo nakedly, and rawly produce the ſole
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:489:43"/>
authoritie of the Councell of <hi>Laterane,</hi> which I haue alreadie in the Preface of my Apologeticall Anſwere fully ſatisfied, and abundantly ſhewed, firſt, that the aforeſaid Councell hath neither defined, nor ſuppoſed as certaine this doctrine of the Popes authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes. And ſecondly, that although it had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this doctrine as true, yet vnleſſe it had ſuppoſed it as certainly, and vndoubtedly true, and not only as probably true, the contrarie opinion may be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without any danger of faith, or any temeritie at all.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But that you may perceiue the weakenes of your argument, tell vs, I pray you, moſt learned <hi>Becanus,</hi> whether all thoſe Diuines, who with might and maine doe defend, that the bleſſed Mother of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued without originall ſinne, among whom are <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Suarez,</hi> both famous Ieſuites, who, to confirme this doctrine, doe alleage the conſent almoſt of the Vniuerſall Church, and the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme aſſent of all Vniuerſities, muſt forthwith auerre, that all other Catholikes, who are not of their opinion, haue erred in this point, or that they in this point know more, then all others, who embrace not their opinion? <hi>What Catholike dare preſume to auerre this much? No man, as I thinke, is ſo arrogant.</hi> May not in the Church of God many opinions be probably defended on both ſides without impeaching, either of errour, temeritie, or any other crime?</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Doth not <hi>Ioan. Maldonate,</hi> an excellent Diuine of your Order, boldly affirme,<note n="g" place="margin">In Summula q. 12. ar. 7. vide etiam qu. 15. ar. 21. &amp; 22.</note> 
                     <hi>that neither the Pope, nor the whole Church hath power to dispenſe in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow of chastitie, and that thoſe Eccleſiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Interpreters of the Canon law, who haue taught the contrarie, doe ſeeme to him to haue had more regard of ſome examples of certaine Popes, then of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For what Diuinitie would auerre, that the Church can dispenſe in the law of God, and nature? But who, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:489:44"/>
an heretike, will deny, that the vow of chastitie doth binde by the law of God, and nature?</hi> And neuertheleſſe I thinke you will ſcarcely affirme, that <hi>Maldonate</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intended to condemne of errour, or any other crime, ſo many Popes diſpenſations, and all thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, who be not of his opinion herein. Truly I am aſhamed, that men of ſo great learning, and who aboue others profeſſe religious perfection, ſhould be ſo ſtiffe in their owne opinions, that they feare not vpon ſleight grounds both againſt the rule of Chriſtian charitie, and in reproch of Catholike Religion, to ſlander moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and vertuous Catholikes, who cleaue not to their opinions, with hereſie, errour, temeritie, or any other grieuous crime. And this may ſuffice for the ſatisfying of <hi>Becanus</hi> his argument, vntill he do demonſtrate, that thoſe anſweres, which I haue made to the <hi>Councell of Laterane,</hi> be altogether improbable.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thirdly, <hi>Franciſcus Suarez</hi> alſo a moſt learned Ieſuite, and one of the chiefe Profeſſors of Diuinitie in this age, in his <hi>Treatiſe of lawes,</hi> lately printed at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> hath alleaged<note n="h" place="margin">Lib. 4. de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus cap. 9.</note> certaine arguments, whereby the aforeſaid <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> may be confirmed; to wit, that the temporall power is ſubiect, and ſubordinate to the ſpirituall, and conſequently that the Pope, for the ſpirituall good, hath power to depoſe Princes, and to diſpoſe of all their temporals: for <hi>the indirect domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or authoritie, <hi>which the Pope hath ouer the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall world,</hi> from which the Diuines do deriue his power to depoſe Princes, <hi>is only grounded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez, in the ſubordination of theſe two powers.</hi> And although the reaſons, which <hi>Suarez</hi> bringeth, be triuiall, and haue long ſince been produced by Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others, yet I thought it neceſſarie to put them downe in this place, for that his authoritie is of great moment with the beſt learned Prieſts of our nation, who with great expectation haue long deſired to ſee, what arguments he could produce to confirme this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:489:44"/>
of depoſing Princes by the Popes authoritie, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring themſelues, that a Diuine of ſo profound erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now at the laſt, after ſo exact debating of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, would bring the very beſt, and choiſeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which could be inuented, <hi>to demonstrate</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid authoritie.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Two therefore onely arguments <hi>Suarez</hi> doth bring to proue the ſubordination of the Eccleſiaſtical, and Ciuill power, <hi>wherein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the indirect domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in temporals, which the Pope hath ouer the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall world, is only grounded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt and principall ground</hi> (as hee ſaith) <hi>of this ſubordination is taken from the vnitie of the Church ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſignified in the Gospell, and declared by S. Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>who ſaith, that we all are baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and,</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>wee being many are one bodie in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>and many other places:</hi> which reaſon <hi>Suarez</hi> dilateth in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Seeing that Chriſt our Lord hath inſtituted his Church as one ſpirituall kingdome, wherein there ſhould be alſo one King, and one ſpirituall Prince, it is neceſſarie, that the temporall power ſhould be ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as the body is ſubiect to the ſoule. For by this example doth Gregorie Nazianzene</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Orat. 17.</hi> ad populum timore perculſum.</note> 
                     <hi>very well declare the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of theſe two powers: for as a man were not well compounded, vnleſſe the bodie were ſubordinate to the ſoule, ſo neither the Church ſhould be conueniently inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, vnleſſe the temporall power were ſubiect to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, as Pope Boniface the</hi> 8, <hi>out of S. Bernard, hath well concluded, affirming, that the ſword muſt be vnder the ſword, and the temporall power muſt be ſubiect to the ſpirituall. For where there is one body, it is neceſſarie that there be one head, whereunto all the members must in ſome ſort haue recourſe; otherwiſe neither peace, nor perfect vnitie could be in the body: But the Church of Chriſt is one body, therefore, although there be in it many powers, or Magistrates, it is neceſſarie, that they haue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:489:45"/>
among themſelues a ſubordination. For as much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it were a peruerſe order, if ſpirituals were ſubiect to temporals, it muſt of neceſſitie be granted, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power is ſubordinate to the ſpirituall. Which ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination may alſo be confirmed by Pope Gelaſius,</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Diſt 96 can. <hi>Duo ſunt.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>who out of thoſe words,</hi> Paſce oues meas, <hi>doth inſinuate, that Kings and Emperours are ſubiect to S. Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. But if thou anſwere, <hi>that Kings and Emperours are ſubiect to S. Peter in his ſpirituall gouernment:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this anſwere <hi>Suarez</hi> replieth in this manner: <hi>For to make</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the temporall gouernment right, and honeſt, it muſt of neceſſitie haue a ſpirituall rule, therefore it is neceſſarie, that the temporall power it ſelfe of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be directed by the ſpirituall: and this is to be ſubiect, and ſubordinate to it. And for this cauſe Popes are to render an account for Kings, and Emperours, becauſe it belongeth to them to correct, and amend in whatſoeuer they, not only as men, but alſo as Kings, ſhall in exerciſing their power offend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The ſecond argument, which <hi>Suarez</hi> bringeth to confirme this ſubordination, is this: <hi>becauſe Chriſt our Sauiour had not otherwiſe ſufficiently prouided for his Church, if he had not giuen her power, to keepe Kings and Princes in due order at the leaſt, by vſing the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. To theſe arguments of <hi>Suarez</hi> I anſwere, that, to ſpeake the truth, I am by them rather much confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in my ancient opinion, to wit, that the doctrine concerning the Popes power to depoſe Princes is not certaine, then any way withdrawne from the ſame. For he affirmeth nothing elſe, then what I will moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant him, and which in my Apologie for the rightfull power of Princes, and my Apologeticall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, I haue more at large declared. Firſt therefore I admit, that the Church of Chriſt is one myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and one ſpirituall kingdome, and that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as well Kings, as Subiects, are members of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:489:45"/>
body. But we vtterly deny, that this ſpiritual kingdome of Chriſt is compounded of the Eccleſiaſticall, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike power; neither will <hi>Suarez,</hi> as I thinke, affirme the ſame, but the only politike, or temporall power doth compound earthly kingdomes, and of the ſole ſpirituall power is compounded the kingdome of Chriſt, as I elſewhere<note n="l" place="margin">In Apolog. nu. 137. &amp; ſeq.</note> out of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> grounds haue more plainly ſhewed, and alſo <hi>Becanus</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Aduerſus Torturam Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti part. 2. cap. 3. arg. 3.</note> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words doth acknowledge the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Moreouer, we grant with Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8, <hi>that the temporall ſword is vnder the ſpirituall, and that the temporall power is ſubiect to the Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> not only in nobilitie, nor yet of it owne nature, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Lib. 5. de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. pont c. 6.</note>, and <hi>Becanus</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">De Primatu Regis Angliae cap. 1. nu. 4.</note> doe well affirme, but only accidentally, in that manner, which I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore<note n="p" place="margin">In the place before cited.</note> more fully declared, to wit, in regard of the ſin, which Princes, when they abuſe their temporal power, doe commit: which in very deede is nothing elſe, then that a temporall Prince in ſpirituall matters is ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the Church. And this is the onely meaning of S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene,</hi> when hee compareth the ſpirituall, and temporall power, to the ſoule, and bodie. Which ſimilitude, as I haue elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="q" place="margin">In the place but now cited, and in my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. anſwere nu. 19. &amp; ſeq.</note> ſhewed, doth rather weaken, then confirme the Popes power to depoſe Princes, and to diſpoſe of their temporals. For as the ſoule hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the body to exerciſe all corporall actions, which are ſubiect to the command of our free will, yet ſhe hath not power of her ſelfe to exerciſe thoſe actions, which are proper to the body, without the helpe and aſſiſtance of a corporall organe; ſo alſo the ſpirituall power of the Church hath authoritie to command the temporall power, or rather a temporal Prince, in whom the ſupreme temporall power doth reſide, to doe all thoſe temporall actions, which are neceſſarie to the preſeruing of the ſpirituall good, yet the ſpirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath not authoritie of her ſelfe to diſpoſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:489:46"/>
things, or which is all one, cannot of her ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe functions, which are proper to the ciuill power, without the aide and concurrance of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Magiſtrate. But all this is nothing elſe, then that temporall Kings, and Princes in ſpirituals, or in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as in regard of the ſin annexed, which is ſpirituall, they are made ſpirituall, be ſubiect to the ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, command, chaſtiſing, and gouernment of the Eccleſiaſticall power. Neither doth <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, when hee affirmeth, that the very power of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning temporally, to make it vertuous, and honeſt, muſt be directed by a ſpirituall rule, proue any thing more then what we haue ſaid, vnleſſe he will contradict both himſelfe, and moſt euident reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Neuertheleſſe, I cannot denie, but that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid aſſertion of <hi>Suarez</hi> is very equiuocall. For if by a <hi>ſpirituall rule</hi> hee vnderſtand a <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall rule,</hi> and by <hi>rectitude,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> hee meane <hi>ſupernaturall rectitude,</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> his aſſertion is moſt true: for, to make <hi>temporall</hi> gouerning to bee good and vertuous <hi>ſupernaturally,</hi> it muſt of neceſſitie be directed and guided by a <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> rule. But if he ſpeake onely of <hi>morall</hi> rectitude, and vertue, it is moſt falſe, that to make temporall gouerning good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>morally,</hi> it muſt of neceſſitie be directed by a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall</hi> rule, but it ſufficeth, if it be directed by the rule of <hi>morall</hi> rectitude and vertue: which <hi>morall</hi> rule, although in ſome ſort it may be ſaid to be ſpirituall, as alſo all <hi>morall</hi> vertues are, which are inherent in the ſoule, which is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> yet it is not an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> or <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> rule. And thus much <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe in the ſame Treatiſe doth ſuppoſe for certaine. For hee admitteth, as vndoubted, that Infidel Princes haue true, and full authoritie to enact iuſt and honeſt lawes, and yet it is manifeſt, that in making ſuch lawes they are only guided, and directed by <hi>morall</hi> rectitude, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, and not by any <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> or <hi>ſupernaturall</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:489:46"/>
rule. And by this the Reader may eaſily perceiue, how weake, and vnſound is the chiefeſt foundation for the Popes power to diſpoſe of temporals, which, as <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>is only grounded in the vnitie of the Church, and in the ſubordination of the temporall power to the ſpirituall.</hi> And thus much concerning <hi>Suarez</hi> his firſt argument.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. His ſecond argument alſo we doe freely grant him. For wee doe willingly admit, that Chriſt hath left in his Church ſufficient power to keepe Kings, and Princes in good order, <hi>at the leaſt by vſing the ſpirituall ſword.</hi> But from hence it cannot be certainly gathered, that the Church hath power to depoſe Princes, or to diſpoſe of their temporals; for ſo he ſhould haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to vſe not only the ſpirituall, but alſo the temporall ſword. And the very ſame reaſons, which our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries can bring to proue, that the Church for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall health of ſoules muſt of neceſſitie haue ſufficient power and authoritie to depoſe Princes, will in like manner conuince, that ſhe muſt alſo haue ſufficient force and meanes to execute this her authoritie, and actuall to thruſt them out of their kingdome: for by the actually reigning of wicked Princes, more then by their right, and title to reigne, the health of ſoules is chiefly endangered. By this therefore it is manifeſt, that <hi>Suarez</hi> is not in very deede contrarie to our opinion, but that rather he may be rightly alleaged for a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer thereof; ſeeing that by his arguments no other thing can be gathered, then that the temporall power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſinne, which is ſpirituall, is ſubiect to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual direction, command, and chaſtiſing of the Church: which both I, and both the <hi>Barclaies,</hi> with all other Catholikes, doe freely acknowledge; and that <hi>Suarez</hi> doth not in very deede diſſent from our opinion, his manner of handling the queſtion doth cleerely ſhew. For vnleſſe hee would in expreſſe words haue auerred, what we affirme, what other thing could he haue ſaid,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:489:47"/>
then that, which he, handling this queſtion of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hath taught, and laſt of all concluded, <hi>that the Church muſt haue a power to keepe Kings and Princes in good order, at the leaſtwiſe by vſing the ſpirituall ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Wherefore to the principall obiection, which is put downe in the beginning of the Chapter againſt this ſecond branch of the oath, it is eaſily anſwered by denying the Minor propoſition, if it be vnderſtood <hi>of all Catholikes,</hi> as without doubt it muſt be vnderſtood to make the argument to haue any colour of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For many Catholikes, whom heretofore<note n="r" place="margin">In my Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie nu 4. &amp; ſeq.</note> I haue named, and ſome of them I will beneath<note n="ſ" place="margin">Sect 3. nu. 5. &amp; ſeq.</note> relate, doe plainly hold, that the Pope hath no authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue Supreme Princes of their kingdomes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of temporall things. And therefore this doctrine of depoſing Princes by the Popes authoritie is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and without all doubt, and much leſſe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued as a point of faith as Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and before them <hi>Gregorius de Valentia</hi> doe ouer raſhly affirme, ſith that the contrarie opinion is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly defended by Catholikes, and conſequently may be maintained without danger of mortall ſinne. But this at this preſent wee doe ſuppoſe both out of that, which we haue alreadie abundantly diſputed, and will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="t" place="margin">Againſt D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> his Apologie for Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>No Catholike can without danger of periurie ſweare that to be true, whoſe truth in the iudgements of all Catholikes is accounted at the leaſt to be doubtfull, for ſo he ſhould expoſe himſelfe to danger of ſwearing an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, but whether the Pope hath power to depoſe Kings and Princes, is by all Catholikes accounted at the leaſt to be a doubtfull, and disputable queſtion, as doth appeare by the ſtreame of Doctors, whereof ſome are of opinion, that this doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, and no man doth condemne it as vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly falſe: therefore no Catholike can, without danger at the leaſt of periurie, ſweare, that the Pope hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to depoſe Kings and Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection two anſwers are vſually made, and both of them doe out of my Apologie for the rightfull power of Princes, and out of <hi>Iohn Barcklay</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">In <hi>Vindicijs</hi> pro Regibus.</note> ſuppoſe, that without any danger of hereſie, errour, or any other crime, it may by Catholikes be probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that the Pope hath not authoritie to depoſe Princes, or, which wee now doe take for all one, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of their lawfull right, and title to reigne: and conſequently, that this queſtion of depriuing Princes by the Popes authoritie, is not a doubtfull thing, to wit, whereof no determinate aſſent can be had, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and by Catholike Doctors controuerted on both ſides. For betwixt <hi>doubfull,</hi> and <hi>probable,</hi> or <hi>disputable,</hi> which two are cunningly confounded in the obiection, there is a great diſtinction, as beneath<note n="z" place="margin">Cap. 10. ſect. 2 nu. 9. &amp; 19.</note> out of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Gabriel Vaſquez</hi> we will ſhew more at large.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſuppoſed, the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>moſt principall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere</hi> is, that the thing, which in this branch of the oath wee doe immediatly, directly, and properly ſweare, is not, <hi>that the Pope hath not authoritie to depoſe the King,</hi> as the obiection doth falſely ſuppoſe, but, <hi>that I doe truly, and ſincerely acknowledge, profeſſe, teſtifie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:489:48"/>
in my conſcience, that the Pope hath not authoritie to depoſe the King,</hi> as the expreſſe words of the oath both in the firſt, and the laſt branch therof do moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare, and alſo<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 2. ſect. 1. nu. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Martinus Becanus,</hi> and Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> whoſe words wee haue before related, doe freely confeſſe: which my ſincere acknowledgement, and declaration of my opinion, ſith that it is in no ſort doubtfull, but phyſically certaine vnto me, I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with a ſafe conſcience, and without any danger of periurie confirme by oath.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſecond anſwere</hi> is, that betwixt depriuing, and depoſing a King, there is a great diſtinction, if wee will ſpeake according to the expreſſe meaning of this oath, which betwixt theſe two doth make a manifeſt difference, as appeareth by thoſe words contained in the fourth branch of the oath, <hi>Princes depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed by their ſubiects, or any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</hi> For to depriue Princes, is by a iuridicall, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence to take away their right, and iuſt title to their kingdomes, which depriuing is in the fourth branch of the oath referred to the Pope; but to depoſe Princes, is to execute this ſentence, and to diſplace, or thruſt them out of the poſſeſſion of their kingdomes, which depoſing is attributed to the ſubiects, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoeuer. If therefore in this ſecond branch of the oath it is only affirmed, that the Pope hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <hi>to depoſe the King,</hi> that is, <hi>to thruſt him out of the poſſeſſion of his kingdome,</hi> then that propoſition, (if we once ſuppoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this his authoritie to depriue Princes, is not decided by the Iudge, nor certainly agreed vpon by Catholikes) is in my opinion morally certaine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it by any Diuine, or Lawyer, whom I haue read, called in queſtion; ſeeing that the Pope hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to depoſe the King, or to put him out of the lawful poſſeſſion of his kingdome, ſo long as it is vncertaine, not decided, and in controuerſie among vertuous and learned Catholikes, whether he hath any ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:489:48"/>
to depriue Princes, or no, as in the end of my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, out of the approued rules of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> law I haue ſufficiently deduced, and alſo out of the knowne principles of Diuinitie, if neede require, I will further confirme.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>THirdly,</hi> againſt this ſecond branch it may be obiected, <hi>that although a learned and skilfull Diuine, who is able to ſearch into the depth of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult controuerſie, and to examine exactly all the reaſons and proofes, which are vſually made againſt, and for the Popes authoritie to depriue Princes of their kingdomes, may perchance haue ſome ſufficient ground prudently to perſwade his conſcience, that the Pope hath no ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; yet an vnlearned man, who for want either of naturall capacitie, or of ſufficient learning, is not able to examine theſe deepe Theologicall queſtions, cannot pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and without euident temeritie frame vnto himſelf a right</hi> dictamen <hi>of conſcience, whereby he may lawfully perſwade himſelfe, that the Pope hath not this authoritie giuen him by Chriſt, which the greater part of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, both Diuines and Lawyers doe conſtantly affirme to be giuen him by Chriſt his inſtitution; therefore at the leaſt an vnlearned man cannot without great temeritie take this ſecond branch of the oath, although he ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweare his opinion, perſwaſion, or declaration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this obiection is eaſily ſatisfied: And firſt it may be anſwered, that although one raſhly conceiuing this, or that opinion, or hauing any bad intention to do euill, doth offend in this, that hee iudgeth raſhly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to doe euill, yet the oath it ſelfe, wherein hee truly auerreth, that he hath this raſh opinion, or wicked intention, may be without any offence at all. As if a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ſhould command his ſubiect to declare vnto him ſincerely his opinion concerning ſuch a matter, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:489:49"/>
ſubiect may lawfully, and without any temeritie tell his opinion, and if neede require, confirme it by oath, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perchance hee conceiued that opinion raſhly, and vnaduiſedly. Wherefore from this obiection it can not well be gathered, that this ſecond branch of the oath cannot without temeritie be taken by vnlearned men, but at the moſt it may be inferred, that vnlearned men cannot without ſome note of temeritie perſwade themſelues, that the Pope hath ſuch authoritie granted him to depriue Princes, albeit, if they haue once, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though raſhly, conceiued ſuch an opinion, they may without any temeritie ſweare this their temerarious opinion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſecond</hi> therefore, and <hi>principall Anſwere</hi> is, that alſo an vnlearned man may with a ſafe conſcience, and without any danger of temeritie take this ſecond branch of the oath, for that he may prudently, and vpon ſufficient grounds perſwade his conſcience, that the Pope hath no authority to depriue Princes granted him by Chriſt his inſtitution. For as heretofore<note n="b" place="margin">In the end of my Apologie.</note> I haue briefly inſinuated, and will beneath<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 10. ſect. 2 nu. 10.</note> repeate the ſame againe, there bee two ſorts of principles, or grounds, whereby a man may be perſwaded, that this, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is true, or falſe. The firſt are called intrinſecall grounds, and doe conſiſt in the diſcuſſing, and debating of all the reaſons and arguments, which may be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for, and againſt any opinion: And theſe kinde of grounds doe only appertaine to learned men, who are able to diſcerne what force the reaſons, and anſwers on both ſides haue. The other grounds are called extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall, and they are only founded vpon the bare autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of prudent, and learned men, vpon whoſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a matter diſputable, and controuerted among Doctors, any man may prudently, and without any note of temeritie relie. And theſe grounds are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon alſo to vnlearned men, who, although they are not able to weigh exactly the reaſons, or intriſecall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:489:49"/>
grounds of this, or that opinion, yet they can eaſilie learne, and diſcerne, what opinion learned men doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And this is a ſufficient ground for vnlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to cleaue vnto the opinion of skilfull, and prudent men, whoſe iudgements, ſith that they themſelues bee not able to diſcuſſe the controuerſie, may ſafely, and ſecurely follow, although the contrarie opinion bee perchance the more probable, the more ſecure, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the greater number of Diuines, as beneath<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 10. ſect. 2 nu. 11. &amp; ſeq.</note> out of the doctrine of <hi>Gabriel Vaſquez,</hi> a moſt learned Ieſuite, I will ſhew more at large.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for example, in this caſe of vſurie there is a great controuerſie among Diuines, whether in lending of money it be lawful to take intereſt <hi>ob lucrum ceſſans,</hi> that is, in conſideration of the profit, or gaine, which the lender might haue made, if he had employed his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney otherwiſe, ſome Diuines affirming, and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to be vſurie. Now, if a vertuous, prudent, and learned Diuine doe confidently tell an vnlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the opinion, which affirmeth it to be no vſurie, is probable, and in practiſe ſecure, and which liketh him beſt, although many others, and perchance the greater, and better ſort of Diuines doe follow the contrarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which alſo without all doubt is the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, yet the authoritie of this learned Diuine is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truer, and more approued opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, a ſufficient ground for the vnlearned man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may ſecurely, and without any note of temeritie perſwade his conſcience, that he may lawfully take <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> for that reſpect, and reiect in practiſe the more common, and the more ſecure opinion of other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, albeit he, ſith that he is vnlearned, be not able to examine the nature, qualitie, and conditions of vſurie. And the like may be applied to this preſent controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of depoſing Princes by the Popes authoritie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuch like diſputable caſes.</p>
                  <p>But that the vnlearneder ſort of people may in part
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:489:50"/>
perceiue, what ſufficient extrinſecall grounds, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of learned and prudent men they may haue, to perſwade their conſcience ſecurely, that the Pope hath not any power to depoſe Princes, and to diſpoſe of their temporals, I will only produce ſome few authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſo many, which I haue heretofore<note n="e" place="margin">In Apolog. &amp; Reſp. Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</note> alleaged.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>firſt authoritie</hi> is of <hi>Iohn Trithemius</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, of the Order of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and a man of ſingular learning &amp; pietie, who writeth, that in his time, to wit, in this preſent age, wherein nothing hath been newly defined either by Councels, or Popes, concerning the Popes authoritie to depriue Princes (for all the decrees of Popes, and Councels, which by Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> are vſually alleaged to confirme the aforeſaid authoritie, were long before <hi>Trithemius</hi> his time) this opinion which denieth the Pope to haue any ſuch authoritie, was probably defended by Scholaſticall Doctors. For ſo he writeth,<note n="f" place="margin">In Chronico Monaſterij Hirſaug the yeare 1106.</note> 
                     <hi>He indeede [Henry</hi> the 4.] <hi>was the firſt among all the Emperours, who was depoſed by the Pope. The Scholaſtickes are at ſtrife, and as yet the controuerſie is not decided by the Iudge, whether the Pope hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to depoſe the Emperour, or no; which queſtion, ſeeing that it belongeth not to vs, we will leaue indiſcuſſed.</hi>

Which Decrees, whether they be iuſt, or no, God knoweth. For I (vnder correction) (and if it ſhould be erroneous I recall it) doe thinke that none of them be agreeable to law. Yea my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that they were publiſhed againſt the rights, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Empire, and I thinke that by God they were inſtituted diſtinct powers.

this queſtion, which is rather a morall, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, then a Theologicall controuerſie, many learned Diuines are of opinion, that the ciuill common-wealth hath no authoritie at all ouer their Soueraigne Prince, and that a Supreme temporal Prince cannot be iudged, and puniſhed with temporal puniſhments, but by God alone, whoſe opinion to condemne as <hi>temerarious,</hi> and improbable, without doubt were great <hi>temeritie.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that this queſtion is probably diſputed on both ſides by Catholike Doctors, the very ſame <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> which before were giuen to the former obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, concerning the Popes power to depoſe Princes, may be alſo applied to this obiection, concerning the power of the ciuill common-wealth to depoſe their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: to wit, that alſo an vnlearned man may by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal grounds, that is to ſay, by reaſon of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of prudent, and learned men, ſecurely perſwade himſelfe, that the ciuill common-wealth hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie at all ouer their Soueraigne &amp; abſolute Prince, and alſo that this his perſwaſion, acknowledgement, and declaration, he may with a ſafe conſcience, if neede require, confirme by oath: And ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in this ſecond branch of the oath I doe not abſolutely acknowledge, teſtifie, and declare, that the ciuill common-wealth hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to depoſe the King; but if in thoſe words <hi>[nor by any other meanes with any other]</hi> wee muſt needes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend alſo the ciuill common-wealth, at the fartheſt I doe acknowledge, that the Pope neither by meanes of the common-wealth, nor with the common-wealth, hath authoritie to depoſe the King; which propoſition verily is moſt true, ſo that we ſuppoſe, that no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath been hitherto granted to the Pope to depoſe abſolute Kings, and Princes. For otherwiſe we ſhould alſo by theſe words expreſſely acknowledge, that the Pope hath authoritie to depoſe the King, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe wee haue before denied. As for example, this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:489:56"/>
propoſition, <hi>A ſtone by meanes of a man, or with a man, hath power to vnderſtand,</hi> is moſt falſe. For although a man be indued with the power of vnderſtanding, yet a ſtone neither without a man, neither with a man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by meanes of a man can vnderſtand. For this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>by meanes,</hi> doth ſignifie a ſecondarie, or inſtrumentall cauſe, which ſuppoſeth a principall, as a man is ſaid to ſee by meanes of his corporall eye: but this prepoſition <hi>with,</hi> doth import vſually a concourſe, or cooperation of two cauſes, as <hi>Socrates</hi> with <hi>Plato</hi> doth draw a boate. In like manner, although it were granted, that the ciuill common-wealth hath power in ſome caſe to depoſe their Prince; yet it doth not therfore follow, that the Pope either with the common wealth, or by meanes of the common-wealth, hath alſo authoritie to depoſe their Prince: for ſo the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as a chiefe and principall cauſe, ſhould alſo haue power to depoſe a Prince, which neuertheleſſe hath not been hitherto by any man ſufficiently proued. As alſo no man can deny, but that this propoſition is moſt true, <hi>A ſtone neither with the common-wealth, nor by meanes of the common-wealth, hath authoritie to depoſe a King.</hi> And although betwixt the Pope and a ſtone there is great difference in this, that a ſtone is not capable of ſuch a power, and therefore neither hath, nor can haue any power to depoſe Princes, yet if we ſpeake onely of the actuall power to depoſe, it is manifeſt, that there is no difference at all betwixt them, if ſo be that wee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Pope hath not as yet any ſuch authoritie granted him. Thoſe therefore, that thinke this oath to be vnlawfull, by reaſon of the aforeſaid words, doe not ſeeme, in my iudgement, with any ſufficient reaſon to be moued thereunto, for that neither the power of the common-wealth to depoſe the King is herein denied, neither can that opinion, which denieth ſuch a power to be in the common-wealth, by reaſon of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſuch famous Doctors, who doe approue it, and for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:489:56"/>
the reaſons, which doe moue them to approue it, be for any ſufficient ground drawne from the principles either of Philoſophie, or Diuinitie, without great <hi>temeritie,</hi> be condemned as <hi>temerarious,</hi> and improbable.</p>

But <hi>Leſſius,</hi> foreſeeing what may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the aforeſaid argument of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> preuenteth the anſwere in theſe words: <hi>You will ſay,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leſſius</hi> his <hi>Recapitulator, that the power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate is not here denied, but onely a certaine effect of excommunication, which is, that notwithſtanding a Prince be excommunicated, yet ſhall not his ſubiects be releaſed from the bond of their allegiance. But this effect doth neceſſarily follow the ſentence of Excommunication, as the practiſe of the Church for the ſpace of more then twelue hundred yeeres doth ſhew, which this Author</hi> [Leſſius] <hi>hath euidently proued in other places of his booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiecton we <hi>anſwere,</hi> that the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to excommunicate the King is not in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:489:58"/>
words denied, but rather granted, and ſuppoſed, as alſo the <hi>Kings</hi> moſt excellent <hi>Maieſtie</hi> in his Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Chriſtian Monarchs doth in expreſſe words auerre<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 9.</note>. For in this branch it is only vertually denied, that Excommunication, being a ſpirituall cenſure, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this temporall effect to depriue Princes of their temporall kingdomes, and dominions, or, which is all one, to make lawfull Kings no Kings, and conſequently to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall obedience, which, according to the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> is by the law of God due to all lawfull Kings. <hi>The truth is,</hi> ſaith his Maieſtie,<note n="f" place="margin">In the place now cited.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Lower houſe of Parliament, at the firſt framing of this oath, made it to containe, that the Pope had no power to excommunicate me; which I forced them to reforme, onely making it to conclude, that no excommunication of the Popes can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant my ſubiects to practiſe agianſt my perſon, or State; denying the depoſition of Kings to be in the Popes lawfull power, as indeede I take any ſuch temporall violence to be farre without the limits of ſuch a ſpirituall cenſure, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is. So carefull was I, that nothing ſhould be contained in this Oath, except the profeſſion of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall allegiance, and ciuill, and temporall obedience, with a promiſe to reſiſt to all contrary vnciuill violence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now let vs examine how ſufficiently Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replieth to this anſwere of his Maieſtie. For whereas his Maieſtie<note n="g" place="margin">In the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the lyes of <hi>Tortus,</hi> nu. 1.</note> had charged <hi>Matthaeus Tortus,</hi> or Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whoſe booke at that time went vnder <hi>Tortus</hi> his name, with lying, for that he had affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>that in the oath of Allegiance the Popes power to excommunicate euen hereticall Kings, is expreſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;</hi> Seeing that, ſaith his Maieſtie, <hi>the point touching the Popes power in excommunicating Kings is neither treated of, nor defined in the oath of Allegiance, but was purpoſely declined:</hi> which his Maieſtie in his Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had before more at large declared, Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">In his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie chap. 15. in the firſt lye.</note> to this <hi>anſwere</hi> replieth in this manner:</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:489:58"/>4. <hi>The Author of the booke did not write, that in the oath of Allegiance the queſtion touching the Popes power in excommunicating Princes is treated of, or properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; for he knew well enough, that in the tenour, or forme of an oath there is no place to dispute Theologicall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. But he affirmed, that in the aforeſaid oath is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Popes power to excommunicate euen hereticall Kings: And that this is true, it is euident by thoſe words of the oath;</hi> Alſo I doe ſweare from my heart, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any declaration, or ſentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or depriuation made, or granted, or to bee made, or granted by the Pope, or his Succeſſors, &amp;c. I will beare faith, and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſors. <hi>But whoſoeuer ſweareth, that he will obey an hereticall King, notwithſtanding the Popes Excommunication, doth not hee together ſweare that hee acknowledgeth not in the Pope, power to excommunicate hereticall Kings? for otherwiſe it were not an oath, but ſacriledge to ſweare, that he will not obey the ſentence of excommunication made by the Pope againſt an hereticall King, if he ſhould beleeue, that the Pope had power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate hereticall Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But this anſwere of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with reuerence to ſo worthie a man, is of no force at all. For, (beſides that hee too rigorouſly wreſteth that word, <hi>[treate of]</hi> as though his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> affirming that the queſtion concerning the Popes power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate was not <hi>treated of</hi> in this oath, ſhould vnderſtand a <hi>Theologicall Treatiſe,</hi> or Diſputation, whereas it is moſt euident, that the true meaning, &amp; intention of his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> is, that nothing at all concerning the Popes power to excommunicate, is either affirmed, or denied in this oath, but all mention of the aforeſaid power was purpoſely declined) his anſwere is neither true, neither, if it were true, doth he thereby cleere himſelfe at all of that falſehood, wherewith his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> doth charge him. For why, I pray you? cannot one, either moued
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:489:59"/>
for hope of gaine, or terrified with feare, ſweare that he will not obey a iuſt excommunication, and by ſo ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring commit ſacriledge, who neuertheleſſe doth not denie the power it ſelfe to excommunicate? How ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of thoſe words, <hi>notwithſtanding any Excommunication I will beare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to his Maieſtie,</hi> or, to ſpeake more plainly, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a iuſt Excommunication, I will not obey it,</hi> rightly deduce, that I therefore, ſo much as obſcurely doe denie the power to excommunicate? But Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that whoſeouer ſweareth in that manner, either denieth the power to excommunicate, or committeth ſacriledge.</hi> Be it ſo. But if his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> would freely grant him this ſecond, this neuertheleſſe granted, I can in no wiſe perceiue how he excuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from falſitie, in that he before not with any diſiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but abſolutely pronounced, <hi>In this branch the Popes power to excommunicate euen hereticall Kings is expreſſely denied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Secondly, neither is that true, which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> vnder the aforeſaid diſiunction, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, to wit, that by ſwearing this branch, either the Popes power to excommunicate is abiured, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge committed. For he that ſweareth, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any ſentence of excommunication to be made againſt the King, yet hee will beare to his Maieſtie true faith, and obedience in temporals, although hee doth ſweare, that hee will obey the King though he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, becauſe Excommunication hath not power to depriue Kings of their temporall dominions, and to take away the temporall obedience of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as very learned Diuine, whom heretofore<note n="i" place="margin">In my Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie nu. 346.</note> I haue cited, doe affirme, yet he doth not ſweare, that hee will not obey a iuſt Excommunication, as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth ill conclude. For although he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the Pope hath authoritie to excommunicate hereticall Kings, yet he doth not beleeue, that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:489:59"/>
being a ſpirituall cenſure, worketh this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effect, to depriue hereticall Princes of their Regall authority, to make kings to be no kings, or to take away from ſubiects their natural and ciuill obedience, which by the law of God, according to Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Before cap. 3. ſect. 5 nu. 3. where alſo we obſerued, that the aforeſaid reduplication added by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine [ſo long as they remaine Kings]</hi> is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</note> opinion, they owe euen to hereticall Kings, ſo long as tney remaine Kings, no whit leſſe then to Catholikes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Finally,</hi> that, which <hi>Leſſius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing of ſubiects from the bond of their allegiance is an effect, which is neceſſarily annexed to the ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, as the practiſe of the Church, for the ſpace of twelue hundred yeares, and vpwards, doth ſhew,</hi> is altogether vntrue. For by no practiſe at al of the Church can it be ſhewed, that the abſoluing of ſubiects from the bond of their allegiance, which by the law of God is due to abſolute Princes, is an effect of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but at the moſt another puniſhment, although ſometimes impoſed together with Excommunication, as <hi>Suarez, Becanus,</hi> and many other Diuines, whom herefore<note n="l" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie nu. 346.</note> I haue related, do in expreſſe words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; (concerning which puniſhment, whether it may for any crime be impoſed by the Popes authoritie vpon abſolute Princes, or only vpon inferiour Princes by the conſent of abſolute Princes, to whom they are ſubiect in temporals it is now a controuerſie among Diuines;) And very lately <hi>Becanus</hi> writeth<note n="m" place="margin">In contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſia Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana cap 3. q 2. pag. 108. and in the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected pag. 122.</note> in this manner: <hi>It is one thing to excommunicate a King and another thing to depoſe him, or to depriue him of his kingdome, neither is the one neceſſarilie connected with the other. Many Kings and Emperours haue been excommunicated, and yet not therefore depoſed; and contrariwiſe many depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and yet not therefore excommunicated.</hi> Now that ſubiects cannot be abſolued from their allegiance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Prince be alſo depriued of his Regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we haue now but a little before cleerely ſhewed out of the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who expreſſely affirmeth, that <hi>to denie obedience to a Prince, ſo long as he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:489:60"/>
remaineth Prince, is repugnant to the law of God,</hi> from which the Pope hath no authoritie to abſolue.

                     <hi>doth import a recalling, or recanting of a former doctrine, which one before hath maintained, and therefore this branch cannot lawfully be taken by him, who neuer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch a doctrine. Seeing therefore that all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſubiects indifferently, and without exception may be compelled by the Magistrate to take this oath, it is euident, that this branch cannot lawfully, and without periurie be taken by thoſe, who neuer maintained this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Popes power to depoſe, or murther Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> that although this word [<hi>abiurare,</hi> to abiure] be ſometimes taken for <hi>to periure</hi>

And although in rigour of ſpeech this word <hi>[to abiure]</hi> ſhould ſignifie to recant, or vnſay by oath that doctrine, which before hee hath maintained, yet according to the plaine and common ſenſe of this word, and according to the vſuall practiſe which is obſerued in abiuring hereſies, or errors, this word <hi>[to abiure]</hi> doth ſignifie to damne, deny, or deteſt by oath not only a doctrine, which before in very deede he hath maintained, but alſo which either he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed maintained, or it is ſuſpected<note n="d" place="margin">Simancas nu. 18.</note>, that he hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

that no Proteſtant, or Puritane, according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Religion, can, without manifeſt periurie, take this branch of the oath. And this his pretended demonſtration may in the very like manner be vrged againſt Catholikes.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the ſumme, and ſubſtance of his demonſtration, and of his whole Dialogue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>No man can without periurie abiure that poſition as hereticall, which is not hereticall, but this poſition,</hi> That Princes, which bee excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may bee depoſed, or murthered by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, or any other whatſoeuer, <hi>is not hereticall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can without periurie abiure it as hereticall.</hi>

For if any one parcell be falſe, before a man hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the whole, hee muſt needs haue ſworne the falſehood contained in that part.

                     <hi>That Hereſie being an error againſt faith obſtinately maintained in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of him, that profeſſeth Chriſt, it muſt needes follow, that nothing can be hereticall, vnleſſe it containe ſome error againſt faith. So that although a poſition bee repugnant to naturall reaſon, yet it is not enough to make it hereticall, vnleſſe it containe ſome falſehood against faith, and conſequently to the expreſſe word of God; which according to the Proteſtants doctrine, is the ſole and only rule of faith, and the onely touchſtone to trie faith from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:489:67"/>
hereſie. Many poſitions are falſe, as that London is but a mile distant from Yorke, but not hereticall, becauſe their falſehood is only repugnant to naturall reaſon, and is not contained in the expreſſe word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe being ſuppoſed, he argueth in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Whenſoeuer an affirmatiue propoſition is hereticall, of neceſſity it muſt either be againſt faith, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the expreſſe word of God, or elſe the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie negatiue muſt be a poſition of faith, and contained in the expreſſe word of God:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But neither this affirmatiue poſition,</hi> That Princes, which bee excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, <hi>is againſt the expreſſe word of God, neither the contradictorie negatiue, to wit,</hi> That Princes being excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may not be depoſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, <hi>is contained in the expreſſe word of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the former poſition,</hi> That Princes being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, or any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, <hi>is not hereticall.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>And if perchance it ſhould bee anſwered, that, whereas it is written in the</hi> 20. <hi>chapter of Exodus,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill: <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 26. Deſtroy him not, for who ſhall lay his hand on the Lord his annoynted, and bee guiltleſſe? <hi>one part of the aforeſaid poſition, to wit,</hi> That Princes may be murthered, <hi>is hereticall, and againſt the expreſſe word of God, and therefore the whole poſition, in regard of this one part, may be abiured as hereticall; yet this anſwere is not ſufficient: For the poſition in hand to wit,</hi> That Princes being excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may bee depoſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, <hi>doth not abſolutely affirme, that Princes, after they be excommunicated, or

depriued by the Pope, may be murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, but with a diſiunction, to wit, my be depoſed, or murthered. And therefore, although the poſition were hereticall, if it did onely affirme, they might be murthered, yet not affirming this, but only that they may be depoſed, or murthered, there is no ſhew of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in it in regard of being contrary to the aforeſaid texts of Scripture, to which it is nothing contrary at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>For according to the moſt true and approued rule of the Logicians, to make a diſiunctiue propoſition, or any thing affirmed vnder a diſiunction, to be falſe and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, it is neceſſarie, that both parts of the diſiunction be alſo falſe and hereticall, neither is it ſufficient, that one only part be hereticall. And therefore although the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the diſiunction, to wit,</hi> That Princes may be murthered, <hi>be hereticall, and againſt the expreſſe word of God, yet becauſe the firſt part of the diſiunction, to wit,</hi> That Princes, being excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed by their ſubiects, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoeuer, <hi>is not hereticall, nor contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God, the whole diſiunction poſition cannot be in very deed hereticall, and therefore by no Proteſtant, or Puritane can it be abiured, as hereticall.</hi> And this is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the pretended demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Author, and alſo of his whole Dialogue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The very ſelfe ſame argument, which this Author maketh againſt Proteſtants, and Puritanes, may in the very like manner bee alleaged againſt Catholikes, who hold, that the infallible rule of faith is the holy word of God deliuered by Scripture, or Tradition, and the true ſenſe, and right meaning thereof declared ſo to be by the Catholike Church, vnto whom the infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the holy Ghoſt, to declare the true ſenſe and meaning of God his holie word, was promiſed by Chriſt our Lord. For neither out of holy Scripture, or Tradition, neither by any definition of the Church, or Generall Councel, can it ſufficiently be proued, that the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:489:68"/>
Pope hath not authoritie to depriue Princes, or that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be depriued by the Pope, they may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, but rather by the continuall practiſe of Popes the contrary ſeemeth to be ſuppoſed for certaine, which alſo Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> both in his Controuerſies, and in his anſwere to Doctor <hi>Barcklay,</hi> doth endeuour (but in vaine) to demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Wherefore in this branch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leſſius,</hi> as his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Recapitulator<note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 54. 55.</note> relateth, <hi>the doctrine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is abiured as hereticall, and impious: For the plaine ſenſe of the oath condemneth not only the opinion of murthering, but alſo of depoſing, and he that taketh the oath, abiureth both the one, and the other. And were the ſenſe ambiguous, yet could it not be taken, it being in a matter belonging to faith, wherein no equiuocation, or ambiguous ſpeeches may bee vſed. Whereby it is euident, that no man can from his heart deteſt this Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as impious, and hereticall, if hee be not himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fallen deeply into hereſie, and impietie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this obiection two Anſwers are vſually made. The firſt, and principal anſwere is, that albeit the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid propoſition, <hi>Princes, which be excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may bee depoſed, or murthered by their Subiects, &amp;c.</hi> doth ſeeme by reaſon of that later coniunction <hi>[or]</hi> to be a diſiunctiue propoſition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Categoricall propoſition of ſuch a <hi>diſiunct predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> as the Logicians terme it, which vertually doth imply, or may bee reſolued into a diſiunctiue propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (to the veritie of which diſiunctiue propoſition is onely required, as it was ſaid in the obiection, that one part of the diſiunction be true, and to make the whole diſiunction falſe, and heretical, both parts of the diſiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be falſe, and hereticall, neither doth it ſuffice that one onely part be falſe and hereticall) Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, according to the common ſenſe, and meaning of the words, it is in very deed, and according to our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:489:68"/>
phraſe, equiualent to a copulatiue propoſition, or rather to a Categoricall propoſition of ſuch a <hi>copulate predicate,</hi> which may bee reſolued into a copulatiue propoſition, to the veritie whereof, according to the Logicians rule, it is contrariwiſe required, that both parts of the copulation be true, and to make the whole propoſition falſe, and hereticall, it is not required, that both parts of the copulation be falſe, and hereticall, but it ſufficeth that one only part thereof be falſe, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall. Neither is it vnuſuall, that a coniunction diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue be ſometimes taken for a copulatiue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe a copulatiue for a diſiunctiue, as we may ſee in <hi>leg. ſape.</hi> ff. <hi>de verborum ſignificat.</hi> Whereof reade <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in cap. <hi>inter caeteras,</hi> extra, <hi>de reſcriptis.

                  <p n="12">12. Wherefore the plaine and vſuall meaning of the aforeſaid propoſition, <hi>[Princes, which be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by their ſubiects, &amp;c.]</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects may depoſe, or murther their Prince, being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or depriued by the Pope,</hi> (for in this laſt the verbe paſſiue is onely changed into the actiue) is, that it is in the free choice of the Subiects to depoſe ſuch a Prince, or, if they will, to murther him. So that if it bee hereticall to affirme, as without doubt it is, that it is in the free power of the Subiects to depoſe, or murther ſuch a Prince, becauſe it is hereticall, and againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God to affirme, that they may murther him, the aforeſaid poſition conſiſting of that diſiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is hereticall, and therefore it may without any danger at all of periurie be abiured as hereticall.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. From hence it may be gathered firſt, that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common, and vſuall vnderſtanding of our Engliſh phraſe, there is a great diſtinction betwixt theſe two verbs <hi>[may]</hi> and <hi>[can.]</hi> For <hi>[can]</hi> doth vſually ſignifie a power in generall, whether it bee naturall, or morall; but <hi>[may]</hi> for the moſt part importeth a morall power; to wit, if it be vſed alone without any coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction following it, moſt commonly it ſignifieth a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to doe the thing propoſed: As, <hi>I may doe this,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that it is lawfull for me to doe this: but if there follow it a coniunction copulatiue, or diſiunctiue, it implieth a choice, or free power to chuſe whether part of the diſiunction, or copulation one will.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Seeing therefore that the Latine verbe <hi>[poſſum]</hi> implieth power in generall, whether it be naturall, or morall, and according to the thing affirmed, or denied, it is limited to a natural, or morall power, as in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Ignis poteſt comburere: The fire hath power to

For both of them doe ſignifie a free power to chuſe which part one pleaſeth: and ſo the coniunction diſiunctiue hath in ſenſe the vertue, and force of a copulatiue, and the copulatiue of a diſiunctiue. Wherefore the ancient

                  <p>Wherefore to the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition it is anſwered, that it is hereticall, and againſt the expreſſe word of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the aforeſaid two texts of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to affirme, that <hi>Princes, which be excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer:</hi> or which is all one, that <hi>Subiects, or any other whatſoeuer, may depoſe, or murther Princes, which be excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope.</hi> For the plaine and common meaning of this propoſition is, as wee haue ſhewed before, that it is in the free power of ſubiects, or of any other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to depoſe ſuch Princes, or if they will, to murther them, which propoſition is flat hereticall.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And whereas it is obiected, that the aforeſaid propoſition, <hi>Princes, which he excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> is a diſiunctiue, <hi>but to the veritie of a diſiunctiue propoſition it is ſufficient, that one part of the diſiunction be true, and to make the whole diſiunctiue propoſition to be falſe, and hereticall, it is neceſſarie, according to the moſt certaine rule of the Logicians, that both parts of the diſiunction be falſe, and hereticall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is <hi>anſwered</hi> firſt to the <hi>Maior,</hi> that although in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſound the aforeſaid propoſition, <hi>Princes which be excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> ſeeme to be diſiunctiue, yet in very deede, and according to the plaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderſtanding of our Engliſh phraſe, it is, as wee haue alreadie ſhewed, equiualent to a copulatiue, to the veritie whereof it is neceſſarie, that both parts of the copulation be true, and to make the whole copulatiue propoſition to bee falſe and hereticall it ſufficeth, that one only part of the copulation be falſe and hereticall. Now that one part of the aforeſaid propoſition, to wit, that, <hi>Princes, which be excommunicated, or depriued by

the Pope, may be murthered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer,</hi> is flat heretical, is too too manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But leſt we ſhould ſeeme to contend about the bare words, wee <hi>anſwere ſecondly,</hi> and grant that the aforeſaid propoſition, <hi>Princes, which be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi> is a diſiunctiue: but then the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be diſtinguiſhed: For when the Logicians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that to the veritie of a diſiunctiue propoſition it is ſufficient that one part of the diſiunction be true, and to make the whole diſiunctiue hereticall, it is neceſſary that both parts of the diſiunction be hereticall, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued rule of the Logicians is to be vnderſtood of an abſolute diſiunctiue, to wit, which doth not vertually containe in it a condition, or free power in the will to chuſe whether part one pleaſeth: For to the veritie of this conditionall diſiunctiue it is neceſſary, that both parts of the diſiunction may be choſen, and if it be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall to affirme, that it is in the free choice of any man to chuſe whether part of the diſiunction he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the whole diſiunctiue propoſition is hereticall. Now that it is hereticall to affirme, that it is in the free power of the ſubiects to depoſe, or if they will, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Prince, being excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, no man can call in queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Neuertheleſſe, the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Dialogue</hi> doth ſeeme to deale ſomewhat cunningly, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth not ſo much to impugne directly the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue propoſition, which is expreſſely contained in the oath, and to proue directly, that the aforeſaid poſition, <hi>Princes being excommunicated, &amp;c. may be depoſed, or murthered,</hi> not to bee hereticall, as the oath affirmeth; but he flieth from the affirmatiue to the negatiue, and endeuoureth to ſhew, that the contradictorie propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, <hi>Princes being excommunicated, &amp;c. cannot be depoſed, or murthered, &amp;c.</hi> is not certaine of faith, nor contained in the expreſſe word of God; from whence he concludeth, that the former affirmatiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:489:72"/>
which is in expreſſe words contained in the oath, is not hereticall; becauſe in what degree or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood any poſition is falſe, in the oppoſite degree of truth the contradictorie muſt be true.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But this <hi>Author</hi> by his manner of arguing ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth deſirous to ſhun the difficultie, and to impugne a propoſition, which is more cleere, and manifeſt, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more obſcure, and equiuocal, which among Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians is accounted a great defect in arguing, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>to proue one thing leſſe manifeſt by another more apparant.</hi> For the falſehood of this affirmatiue poſition, <hi>Princes, which bee excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed, or murthered by their ſubiects, &amp;c.</hi> or which is all one, <hi>Subiects may depoſe, or murther their Prince, being excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> is more cleere and manifeſt in the common vnderſtanding of our Engliſh phraſe, then is the truth of this negatiue, <hi>Subiects may not depoſe, or murther their Prince who is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi> by reaſon of that negatiue aduerbe <hi>[not]</hi> which, as the Logicians ſay, is of a malignant nature; for that it deſtroyeth, or denieth whatſoeuer followeth after it, making an affirmatiue to be a negatiue, and a negatiue to be an affirmatiue, an vniuerſall to be a particular, and a particular to be an vniuerſall<note n="r" place="margin">As this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>all men are ſenſible,</hi> is by putting <hi>not</hi> in the beginning, <hi>Not all men are ſenſible,</hi> made a particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue.</note>. So that the meaning of the aforeſaid negatiue propoſition is by reaſon of that negatiue aduerbe <hi>[not]</hi> made ambiguous, and may haue this ſenſe, that <hi>Subiects may neither depoſe, nor murther their Prince, being excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo vnderſtood is not of faith, neither in very deed contradictorie to the proper and vſuall meaning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Engliſh phraſe, of the former affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue which is abiured in the oath.

For as the ſenſe of the affirmatiue is, as we haue ſhewed before, that it is in the free choice of the ſubiects either to depoſe their Prince being excommunicated, &amp;c. or, if they will, to murther him, which is falſe, hereticall, and againſt thoſe expreſſe words of Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill; Deſtroy him not, &amp;c.</hi> So the ſenſe of the negatiue contradictorie muſt be, that it is not in the free choice of the ſubiects to depoſe ſuch Princes, or if they pleaſe, to murther them; which propoſition is moſt true, and contained in the expreſſe word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in their free power to murther them, as is manifeſt by the former places of Scripture. And this, which hath been ſaid, is ſufficient for any man, but of meane learning, to perceiue both the weakenes of this Authors pretended demonſtration, or rather ſcarce probable argumentation taken from the nature and qualitie of a diſiunctiue propoſition, and alſo how raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without ſufficient proofe, <hi>Leſſius,</hi> as his Engliſh <hi>Recapitulator</hi> relateth, ſo barely affirmeth, <hi>that in this branch the Catholike doctrine is abiured as hereticall, and impious, and that the plaine ſenſe of the oath doth not only condemne the opinion for murthering Princes, but alſo for depoſing them.</hi>

of this firſt anſwere to the former obiection, I haue in this Engliſh Edition purpoſely omitted.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. <hi>The ſecond principle anſwere,</hi> which ſome of our countrimen doe make to the aforeſaid obiection, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Now to omit that word <hi>[murthered]</hi> as though there were no mention at all made in the oath concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the murthering of Princes, and to ſpeake onely of depoſing them; theſe men affirme, that the aforeſaid poſition, <hi>Princes, which be excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer,</hi> ſuppoſing that this queſtion concerning the Popes power to depoſe Princes is not yet decided, is in their iudgements a falſe, and ſeditious propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it hath ſome ſimilitude with errour, and hereſie; not for that they thinke it to be in very deede hereticall, or erroneous, but for that they doe conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold it to be of ſuch a nature, that it may be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church as an erroneous, and hereticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if <hi>depoſing</hi> be taken in that ſenſe, as it is in this branch of the oath diſtinguiſhed from <hi>depriuing.</hi> For to <hi>depriue a Prince,</hi> is to take away by a lawfull ſentence his Regall authoritie, and in this branch is referred to the Pope, but to <hi>depoſe a Prince,</hi> is to thruſt him out of

the poſſeſſion of his kingdome, and in this branch is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection <hi>it is anſwered</hi> by denying both the <hi>Maior,</hi> and the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition. For <hi>to detest and abhorre</hi> a doctrine (which is all one with <hi>to abiure,</hi> if this deteſtation be confirmed by oath) being an act of the will, and not of the vnderſtanding, wherein truth, and falſehood doe onely reſide, is not to affirme, that the doctrine, which I deteſt, is at that time defended by any, but it doth onely ſignifie, that I haue a great diſlike, and hatred (of which my diſlike I call God to witneſſe) to that doctrine, whether heretofore it hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or hereafter may be maintained, or that time, when I abiure it, it is maintained, or elſe ſuſpected to be maintained by any.

For if before any publike Excommunication, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of depriuation denounced by the Pope againſt the aforeſaid three Kings, thoſe Traitours thought it lawfull to murther them, how much more would they approue this doctrine to murther Princes as lawfull, if

                     <note n="a" place="margin">In reſponſ. ad Apolog. pag. 10 of the Collen edition 1610.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth againſt thoſe words, <hi>[That the Pope hath not power to abſolue mee from this oath, or any part thereof,] in which words,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Popes power to abſolue, or looſe is denied. For out of thoſe words of our Sauiour, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou ſhalt looſe vpon earth, ſhall be looſed alſo in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, all Catholikes doe gather, that it belongeth to the Popes authoritie, not onely power to abſolue from ſinnes, but alſo from Puniſhments, Cenſures, Lawes, Vowes, and Oathes, whenſoeuer it is expedient to the glorie of God, and the health of ſoules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this <hi>obiection</hi> it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> that in this branch of the <hi>oath</hi> is not denyed in general the Popes power to abſolue from <hi>oaths,</hi> as ſome vnlearned Catholikes doe imagine, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by vrging this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſeemeth deſirous to perſwade them to the ſame; but heerein is onely denied the Popes power to abſolue mee from <hi>this oath,</hi> or any part thereof. Neither is this manner of arguing to be approued as lawfull, but to bee reiected as deceiptfull, and captious. <hi>The Pope hath not authority to abſolue me from this oath, therefore hee hath not authority to abſolue from oaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All Catholikes doe acknowledge, that the Pope hath power to abſolue from puniſhments, lawes, vowes, and oaths, but not from all: who will affirme, that hee hath authoritie to abſolue a Theefe, or Traitor iuſtly condemned by the Secular Magiſtrate to death, from the gallowes? Very many Diuines both vertuous, and learned doe auerre, that the Pope hath not power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue any man from the ſolemne vow of Religion, and that he hath not authoritie out of his owne territories, to make a baſtard ſo legitimate in temporals, that hee ſhall haue as much right to inherite as other lawfull
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:489:76"/>
children haue. And from oaths, if the abſoluing from them ſhould tend to the temporall preiudice of a third perſon, many Catholike Doctors are of opinion, that the Pope hath no authoritie to abſolue, vnleſſe hee haue temporall iuriſdiction ouer that third perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To that, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, I anſwere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">In tract. de poteſt. Regia, &amp; Papali cap. 15</note>, <hi>according to Saint Chryſoſtome, and Rabanus, that by this is not vnderstood to be giuen him any authoritie, but ſpirituall, to wit, to abſolue from the bond of ſinnes. For it were folly to vnderſtand, that by this is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen authoritie to abſolue from the bond of debts.</hi> And therefore this manner of arguing, from a particular to infer an vniuerſall, is not onely deceitfull, and captious, but being in a matter of ſo great importance, as to proue, that no Catholike can without flat deniall of the Catholike faith take this oath, to the perpetuall loſſe of his libertie, and of all his goods, and to the vtter ruine of his whole poſteritie, it is, I ſpeake it with griefe, too too pernicious. And whether Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by theſe his ſophiſticall arguments giuing cauſe to ſo great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of Catholikes, be bound to reſtitution, I leaue it both to his owne conſcience, and to the vertuous, and learned Reader to examine.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beſides, what exceſſiue, and almoſt illimitate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hee giueth to the Pope, to abſolue from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lawes, vowes, and oaths, to wit, <hi>whenſoeuer it is expedient to the glorie of God, and the health of ſoules,</hi> (ſeeing that there can ſcarcely be aſſigned any certaine limit of thoſe things, which are expedient to the glorie of God) and what great inconueniencies both to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Subiects by this doctrine may ariſe, I haue in an other place<note n="c" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie nu. 52. &amp; ſeq.</note> partly inſinuated, and partly the prudent Reader will eaſilie comprehend. The truth of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith neceſſarie to eternall ſaluation can be no whit preiudiciall either to Pope, Princes, or Subiects, and therefore it ought by Doctors, and Paſtors to be cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perſpicuouſly, and without artificious colouring of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:489:76"/>
words to be declared &amp; propounded to the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, as they are fearfull to diſobey the Pope, whom they acknowledge to be their ſupreame Paſtour in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, ſo alſo they are deſirous to yeeld all obedience by the law of God, and nature due to their lawfull Prince, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they profes to be their ſoueraigne Lord in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porals</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that the Reader may moſt clearly perceiue, vpon how weak a ground Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the reſt, who condemne this branch of the oath as vnlawfull, do rely, it is to be obſerued, that there are two kindes of oaths aſſigned by the Diuines,<note n="d" place="margin">S, <hi>Thom.</hi> 22. q 89 ar. 7. &amp; 9. <hi>Caiet</hi> ibidem. <hi>Petrus Aragona</hi> ibidem art. 3. 7 &amp; 9 Greg. de <hi>

As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, I ſweare that I haue euer been a moſt loyal Subiect to <hi>King Iames.</hi> I ſweare, that I doe truely, and ſincerely acknowledge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>King Iames</hi> is my Soueraigne Lord in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, &amp; that he is lawfull King of this Kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I ſweare, that I doe from my heart deteſt this impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine, which teacheth, that Princes, although they be excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be murdered by their ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, and ſo of the reſt. And this <hi>aſſertorie oath</hi> can not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed withall, neither hath the <hi>Pope</hi> power to abſolue any man from the bond of this kind of Oath. The reaſon is, becauſe the matter of this oath, or, which is all one, that thing which in this oath is affirmed or denied, being of an act preſent or paſt, is now made altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and irreuocable, for that as ſoone as euer the Oath was made, it was either true, or falſe by reaſon of the truth or falſhood of the act, which now is paſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that it is impoſſible, that the act, which is paſt, be not paſt, ſo alſo it is impoſſible, that the <hi>Popes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation, or abſolution can alter it, or recall it. For it is impoſſible, that the act of ſwearing, which is now, or hath been true, be not now, or hath not been true.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The <hi>Pope</hi> indeed hath power to abſolue any man in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:489:77"/>
the Court of conſcience from the ſin, or offence, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by falſe, vniuſt, or inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderate ſwearing he hath offended, and being penitent doth confeſſe the ſame: but this is not the plaine &amp; common meaning of this word <hi>[abſolue]</hi> contained in this branch of the Oath, as ſome vnlearned Catholikes with vs doe imagine, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are fearefull to take this branch, ſuſpecting that the Popes power to abſolue from ſins in the Sacrament of Penance, is abiured herein. For to abſolue from an Oath, is all one, with to diſpenſe therein, or to releaſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof; but no diſpenſation, or abſolution can make, that the act of ſwearing, which is, or hath beene falſe, is not, or hath not bin falſe. And therfore according to the common doctrine of all Diuines, <hi>diſpenſation, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, commutation, relaxation, irritation</hi> are not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, neither doe they appertaine <hi>to aſſertorie oathes,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>A promiſſorie oath</hi> is that, which is taken for the performing, or not performing of ſome future thing. As for example, I ſweare that I will alwaies beare true faith and allegiance to King <hi>Iames,</hi> that I will to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power defend him from all conſpiracies, and wil doe my beſt endeuour to make them knowne to his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> But in this <hi>promiſſorie oath,</hi> one thing I doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, to wit, that, when I do promiſe, I do ſincerely, and vnfainedly promiſe; the other thing I doe promiſe, to wit, that I will truely performe what I doe promiſe; or to vſe other words, which in ſenſe are al one; in this <hi>promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie oath</hi> two kinds of truth are to be conſidered, one is alreadie preſent, which doth conſiſt in this, that he, who ſweareth, doe affirme the truth, which is, that he haue a preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt intention, vnleſſe hee will be periured, to make that true, or, which is all one, to performe that, which he hath promiſed to performe; which act of ſwearing doth not differre from the nature and quality of an <hi>aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie oath</hi> and therfore is altogether inuariable and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable: the other truth is future, which doth conſiſt in this, that he make that true which he promiſed, by really
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:489:77"/>
performing that thing which hee ſwore to performe, which thing to be performed, ſeeing that it is variable in ſuch ſort, that in ſome caſe the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof may be vnlawful or hurtful, therfore ſuch a promiſſorie oath may be diſpenſed withall, becauſe ſuch a diſpenſation &amp; abſolution is not from the act of ſwearing, but from the the thing which is ſworne, in ſuch ſort, that as by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the oath I was bound to performe that thing, which by oath I promiſed to performe, ſo by vertue of abſolution or diſpenſation, I am freed from performing the ſame. For this is the effect of abſolution and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation, that the thing, which before was a fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſworne, and to bee performed, now vpon iuſt occaſion is no fit matter to be ſworne, or to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. As for example, if one ſhould ſweare to faſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſhould be doubtfull, that this faſting would be either euil, or an hindrace of greater good, he might alſo iuſtly doubt, that it is now no longer a fit thing to be ſworne, or performed: and therefore according to the common opinion of Diuines, an abſolution and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation therein may be iuſtly demanded, and alſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, who hath authoritie to diſpenſe in oaths.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now in this oath of allegiance, which containeth many particular oaths, three onely things I doe promiſe to performe, all which are comprehended in the third branch of the oath, to wit, <hi>that notwithſtanding any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or ſentence of Excommunication, or depriuation made, or to be made againſt the ſaid King, his Heires or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, or any abſolution of the ſaid ſubiects from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> Firſt, <hi>I will beare faith, and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſours.</hi> Secondly, <hi>I will to the vttermost of my power defend him, and them againſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, and attempts whatſoeuer, which ſhall be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His, or their Perſons, their Crowne and dignitie, by reaſon or colour of any ſuch ſentence, declaration, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>I will doe my beſt endeuour to diſcloſe and mae knowne vnto his Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſors,

                  <p>The <hi>firſt obiection,</hi> which in order is <hi>Gretzers</hi> fifth argument, is this:</p>

                     <hi>Whoſoeuer denieth, that the Supreme Paſtor of the Church hath power to looſe all that the looſing whereof is euidently neceſſarie to the preſeruation, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt his flocke, denieth the Catholike faith; but he that taketh this oath, denieth this, therefore he denieth the Catholike faith.</hi>

                     <hi>The Maior propoſition is certaine out of that Mat.</hi> 16. I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. <hi>For what? vnleſſe to open, and ſhut, or which is all one, to looſe, and binde, when euident neceſſitie doth ſhew, that

there is need of opening, or ſhutting, looſing, or binding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Minor is proued; becauſe in this oath the ſwearer denieth generally, that the Pope hath power to abſolue ſubiects from their oath of allegiance, therefore he denieth that then alſo it may be done, when the preſeruation and ſafetie of Chriſts flocke doth euidently require the ſame, becauſe the oath is generall, and without any exception.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond obiection,</hi> which in order is <hi>Gretzers</hi> ſixth argument, is this:</p>

                     <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeueth, and in his conſcience is firmely reſolued, that the Supreme Paſtor of the Church, or his Lieutenant, hath not power to abſolue any man from the bond of the oath preſcribed by King Iames, if either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, or for feare he tooke the ſame, denieth the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith: But he that taketh this oath beleeueth this, and in his conſcience is firmely ſo reſolued, therefore hee denieth the Catholike faith. The Maior is manifeſt out of that,</hi> whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe vpon earth, ſhall be looſed alſo in heauen. <hi>Wherefore vnder this</hi> [whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer] <hi>ſhould not be comprehended this oath, which is ſo pernicious to ſoules, and to the Catholike Religion?

The Concluſion good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe are the arguments of <hi>Gretzer,</hi> which are different from the obiection of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sect. 1. nu. 1. &amp; ſeq.</note>, before related, and anſwered in this, that Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> out of that, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, &amp;c.</hi> doth for the ground of his reaſon deduce this propoſition, to wit, <hi>that according to the doctrine of all Catholikes the

But <hi>Gretzer</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more warily. For he out of thoſe words, <hi>whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou ſhalt looſe, &amp;c.</hi> doth for the ground of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely inferre this propoſition, to wit, <hi>that the Pope hath power granted him to looſe, and binde euery thing, when it is euidently neceſſarie to the preſeruation, and ſafetie of Chriſt his flocke.</hi> Neuertheleſſe this ground of <hi>Gretzer</hi> is in ſubſtance all one with the ſecond, and fifth reaſon, which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies brought to proue the Popes authoritie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of temporals for the ſpirituall good. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of my Apologie, wherein I haue out of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne principles cleerely ſhewed the weakenes of theſe his arguments, the anſwere to this ground of <hi>Gretzers</hi> will moſt eaſily appeare.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wherefore to the firſt argument of <hi>Gretzers</hi> it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> that to make his <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, thoſe words, <hi>looſe,</hi> and <hi>looſing,</hi> are not to bee vnderſtood of temporall, but onely of ſpirituall <hi>looſing,</hi> and only concerning ſuch perſons, ouer whom he hath ſpirituall iuriſdiction. Otherwiſe out of that, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, &amp;c.</hi> one might inferre, that the Pope hath power to binde the Diuell from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men, and withdrawing them from the Catholike faith: For ſo the <hi>interlineall Gloſſe</hi> doth vnderſtand thoſe words,<note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>whatſoeuer you ſhall binde, &amp;c. with the bond,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>of Excommunication.</hi> And <hi>Suarez</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Tom. 5. diſp. 1. ſect. 2. nu. 3.</note>, a moſt famous Diuine of the Societie of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>But that, which is added,</hi> ſhall bee bound alſo in heauen, <hi>doth ſufficiently declare, that this power is not naturall, but ſupernaturall, and that bond to be ſpirituall, and of an higher order.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis,</hi> before<note n="m" place="margin">In this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſect. 1. nu. 4.</note> related, citeth S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:489:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Rabanus.</hi> Now it is manifeſt enough, that to diſpoſe of temporals, to depriue Kings of their temporall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and liues, are not ſpirituall, but temporall <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If therefore the ſenſe of the <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition be that the chiefe Paſtor of the Church hath power by ſpirituall looſing and binding, to looſe, and binde all that, whoſe looſing and binding is euidently neceſſarie to the preſeruation, and encreaſe of Chriſt his flock, we grant the <hi>Maior,</hi> otherwiſe we denie it. For out of this place,<note n="n" place="margin">Matth 16.</note> 
                     <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, &amp;c.</hi> and out of that other,<note n="o" place="margin">Iohn the laſt chapter.</note> 
                     <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi> no other thing can be certainly concluded, but that all ſpirituall power, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to the gouernment of the Church, hath been giuen to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Church, which as by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is not a temporall, but a ſpirituall common-wealth, as I haue heretofore<note n="p" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie nu. 83. &amp; ſeq.</note> declared more at large, ſo alſo it ought to haue all authoritie, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of a ſpirituall common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Wherefore to the ſpirituall looſing of the bond of an oath two things are principally required: the <hi>firſt,</hi> a power to diſpenſe, or abſolue from the oath: the <hi>ſecond,</hi> a ſufficient cauſe, for which the oath may bee diſpenſed withall; to wit, that the diſpenſation, or abſolution bee granted with reaſon, circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, prudence, and diſcretion, when neceſſitie, or great vtilitie requireth. For otherwiſe if an oath be diſpenſed withall without a ſufficient cauſe, although the diſpenſer or abſoluer haue ſufficient authoritie to diſpenſe, or abſolue, yet the diſpenſation, or abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather a diſſipation, neither before God, and in conſcience is it of any force at all. Therefore <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, circumspection, prudence, and diſcretion,</hi> which <hi>Gretzer</hi> mentioneth, doe ſuppoſe indeede authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to diſpenſe, but they giue not authoritie, and for that cauſe are required to diſpenſing, that he, who hath authoritie to diſpenſe, or abſolue, may rightly, lawfully,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:489:82"/>
and without any ſinne at all exerciſe his authoritie. For although the Pope ſhould, for example, diſpenſe with any man in the ſolemne vow of chaſtitie, and in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing vſe neuer ſo much <hi>reaſon, circumſpection, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and diſcretion,</hi> neuertheleſſe wee could not from thence rightly conclude, that the Pope hath ful and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authoritie to diſpenſe in that vow, ſeeing that according to the doctrine of <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Ieſuite, who followeth herein the opinion of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and other excellent Diuines, that vow is not ſubiect to the Popes power of diſpenſing. And thus much concerning <hi>Gretzers Maior</hi> propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Concerning his <hi>Minor,</hi> we denie <hi>firſt,</hi> that to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue ſubiects from their temporal allegiance, to thruſt Princes out of their temporall Dominions, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of temporal things, are to be numbred among ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, but onely among temporall <hi>looſings,</hi> and which therefore are not agreeable to the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſpiritual common-wealth, <hi>which,</hi> as Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the eighth affirmeth,<note n="q" place="margin">Cap. <hi>Porro.</hi> 16 q. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>knoweth not corporall weapons,</hi> and, as Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Cap. <hi>Inter haec,</hi> 33. q. 2.</note> writeth, <hi>hath no other ſword then ſpirituall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> wee alſo denie, that to depriue Princes of their kingdomes, or life, to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall allegiance, and to diſpoſe of temporall things, are euidently neceſſarie to the preſeruing, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of Chriſt his flocke, as heretofore<note n="ſ" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie nu. 182. &amp; ſeq.</note> out of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> grounds I haue moſt cleerely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The viſible Paſtors of Chriſts flocke in earth are bound by the law of Chriſt, to vſe all thoſe meanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by him, which are euidently neceſſarie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his flocke from the cruell aſſault of rauening wolues, and yet neither S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other of thoſe holy <hi>Popes</hi> of the Primitiue Church, who liued vnder moſt cruell perſecutors of the Church, euer vſed theſe meanes to depoſe Princes, and to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall allegiance, which without all doubt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:489:83"/>
they muſt, and would haue vſed, if they had been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to the preſeruation of Chriſt his flock. And might not <hi>Gretzer,</hi> I pray you haue brought the ſelfeſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the murthering of wicked Princes, when there is no other way to depoſe them, or thruſt them out of their kingdome? Might it not alſo by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be conuinced, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord hath giuen to his Church, not onely ſufficient authoritie to depriue Princes, but alſo ſufficient force actually to depoſe them, and to thruſt them out of their actuall poſſeſſion, conſidering that the actuall depoſing of wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is for the moſt part more neceſſarie to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and encreaſe of Chriſt his flock, then is her ſole authoritie to depriue them by a iuridicall ſentence of their Regall authoritie?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To <hi>Gretzers</hi> ſecond argument, whoſe ſolution will more cleerely appeare by the anſwere to the next obiection, it is anſwered by denying his <hi>Minor.</hi> For he denieth not the Catholike faith, who in heart &amp; words doth acknowledge, beleeue, and firmely perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the Pope hath not power to abſolue him from the bond of this oath. <hi>For the bond of an oath,</hi> as well ſaith S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">2. 2. q. 89. ar. 7.</note> with whom all other Diuines doe accord, <hi>is referred to ſome thing, which is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or omitted: wherefore it doth not appertaine to an aſſertorie oath, which is of a thing preſent, or paſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a promiſſorie oath.</hi> Now in this oath, as I haue ſaid before<note n="u" place="margin">In this chapt. ſect. 1. nu. 9.</note>, three onely things are promiſed, which the ſwearer is bound to performe, to wit, <hi>to beare faith, and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, to defend him to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of his power againſt all treaſons and conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to doe his beſt endeuour to make them knowne to his Maieſtie,</hi> from the obligation whereof the Pope without doubt hath no authoritie to abſolue his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as wee<note n="x" place="margin">In this chapt. ſect. 1. nu. 9.</note> haue cleerely deduced out of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrines, before<note n="y" place="margin">Chap. 3. ſect. 5 nu. 3.</note> related, vnleſſe of a King he hath authoritie to make him no King; which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:489:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether it bee granted to the Pope, is not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but <hi>thereof not onely the Scholaſticks doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and as yet the Iudge hath not decided it,</hi> as <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> affirmeth, but alſo the moſt noble kingdome of France, if any credit is to be giuen to <hi>Petrus Pithaeus,</hi> doth ſuppoſe the contrarie to be certaine.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wherefore <hi>Gretzer</hi> doth without ſufficient proofe affirme, that <hi>this oath is pernicious to ſoules, and to the Catholike religion:</hi> For neither <hi>Gretzer,</hi> nor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> nor any other hath with any firme and ſolid reaſon hitherto proued, that in this oath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thing, which is repugnant to Catholike faith, or the health of ſoules. And, to vſe <hi>Gretzers</hi> words, It were truly wonderfull, if the Popes power were ſo great, that it could make void, or diminiſh that Regall power, which the law of God and nature hath granted to Princes, and that temporall allegiance which by the ſame law of God and nature is due to them. Neither is that <hi>[whatſoeuer]</hi> which <hi>Gretzer</hi> doth ſo often inculcat, to be taken generally, but with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient diſtribution, or limitation, as the Logicians ſpeake, as he may perceiue by <hi>Maldonate,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diuines, whom <hi>Maldonate</hi> doth follow. And I would to God that <hi>Gretzer,</hi> and ſome others, who are ſo vehement againſt the oath, would ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with themſelues, what great account they are to make in the dreadfull day of Iudgement to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtor and Iudge of all, for maintaining ſo ſtifly their owne opinions, and thoſe not grounded vpon any ſolid reaſon, but onely vpon ſophiſticall deductions, will needs haue the ignorant people, (who are not able to examine their ſophiſmes, but doe only relie on their authoritie, as being men of ſuch ſingular learning) to beleeue them as an vndoubted doctrine of faith, and which without danger of hereſie or error, may not be impugned, and that in things of no ſmall moment, but which, if they bee not true, may tend to the great
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:489:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reproch of the Catholike faith, to very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Sea Apoſtolike, to the infinite wrong of Soueraigne Princes, and to the perpetuall temporall ouerthrow of very many Catholikes, and of their whole poſteritie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In euery oath, which is taken to confirme the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſome future thing, which is otherwiſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the law of God and nature, two ſorts of obligations may be diſtinguiſhed: The firſt bond is naturall, or ciuill, which is precedent to the oath, and which hath force to binde, before any oath to confirme the ſame be taken. The other is ſacred, or religious, which either freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint, or for feare is made to confirme the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bond, and wherein the bond, or obligation of an oath doth properly, and formally conſiſt, and which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away doth not of neceſſitie diſſolue the former bond.

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his Succeſſors to diſpenſe, or abſolue from oaths vpon a reaſonable cauſe, it cannot doubtleſſe be denied, but that the Pope hath power to diſpenſe, or abſolue, vpon iuſt cauſe, from euery oath, that is, from the ſacred and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obligation thereof, although perchance it be denied, that hee hath authoritie to abſolue from the precedent naturall, or ciuill obligation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Now that there is a iuſt cauſe, which may moue the Pope to diſpenſe, or abſolue from this oath, that is, from the religious obligation, wherein the ſubſtance of an oath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally conſiſteth, is too too manifeſt. For as all Diuines, and Lawyers doe confeſſe, among other ſufficient cauſes, which are required to demaund, and grant an abſolution from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:489:84"/>
an oath, theſe two are the principall. The firſt is, if the oath be enforced, and extorted through feare: the other, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him to whom the oath was made, for ſome notorious crime by him committed: As to puniſh excommunicated perſons, the oaths, which are made to them, are releaſed, and their ſubiects are reſolued from their oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> can. Nos Sanctorum, <hi>and</hi> can. Iuratos 15. q. 6. <hi>and</hi> can. Abſolutos, <hi>extra,</hi> de haereticis. <hi>But in regard of both theſe cauſes the Pope may abſolue from this oath of allegiance. For firſt it is extorted from the ſubiects for feare of loſing all their lands, goods, and libertie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our King is no Catholike, but rather an aduerſarie to Catholike Religion: and therefore in conſideration of both theſe cauſes this oath of allegiance, that is, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſacred obligation thereof may by the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie be releaſed, if any credit be to be giuen to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of holy Church: Therefore it is not lawfull for any ſubiect to ſweare, that the Pope hath not power to abſolue him from this oath, or any part thereof, which at the leaſt, if we will ſpeake properly, and formally, ought doubtleſſe to bee vnderſtood of the ſacred, and religious obligation, wherein the ſubstance of euerie oath doth formallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To this obiection, in ſoluing whereof, for that ſome of our countrimen both graue, and otherwiſe learned, doe make great reckoning thereof, I muſt bee ſomwhat the longer; it is anſwered <hi>firſt,</hi> that the plaine, common, and vſuall ſignification of this propoſition, <hi>The Pop hath power to abſolue me of this oath,</hi> is, that the Pope hath power to abſolue me, not only from the thing ſworne, with this reduplication, <hi>as it is ſworne,</hi> but alſo abſolutely <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing it ſelfe, which is ſworne;</hi> or which is all one, not only to abſolue me from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and religious bond, but alſo from the naturall and ciuill obligation. Seeing therefore that a <hi>promiſſorie oath,</hi> which only is ſubiect to diſpenſation, or abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth formally conſiſt in this, that God his holie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:489:85"/>
name is brought as a witnes for the performing, or not performing of ſome future thing, as in this oath I doe only promiſe to performe theſe three things, to wit, that I will beare faith, and true allegiance to his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> that I will defend him againſt all Treaſons, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous conſpiracies, and that I will doe my beſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to make them knowne to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> if they ſhal come to my knowledge; when it is affirmed, that the Pope hath not power to abſolue me from this oath, or any part thereof, by this according to the common meaning of the words it is ſignified, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue me leaue either not to beare faith, and true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> or not to defend him againſt all treaſons, or not to diſcloſe them to his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> And this alſo is the vſuall practiſe of Popes, that when they releaſe ſubiects of the <hi>oath</hi> of allegiance, they doe not only abſolue them <hi>from their allegiance as ſworne,</hi> but ſimply, and abſolutely <hi>from their allegiance it ſelfe,</hi> or from the naturall bond of their obedience, as plainly may be ſeene in the canon, <hi>Nos Sanctorum,</hi> and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <hi>Iuratos</hi> 15. q. 6. before cited. And therefore this diſtinction of the ſacred and ciuill bond of an <hi>oath,</hi> little auaileth to proue this branch of the oath to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beſides, this alſo ſeemeth to bee the minde, and chiefe meaning of the Law-maker, which for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of the words of lawes is principally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. For I thinke his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> doth little regard, whether the Pope hath power to abſolue his ſubiects from the ſacred bond of <hi>this oath,</hi> ſo that he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that notwithſtanding the releaſing of the ſacred bond, yet the ciuill and naturall allegiance of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, for confirmation whereof this oath is moreouer added, doe remaine inuiolable, and indiſpenſable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Popes authoritie may it any waies be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but that his ſubiects, after they be abſolued by the Pope from the ſacred bond of the oath, are neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:489:85"/>
by the law of God and nature, obliged to beare faith and true allegiance to his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> although wee ſhould grant, that the common meaning of theſe words, <hi>to abſolue me from this oath,</hi> were to abſolue me only from the ſacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, wherein the formall ſubſtance of an oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, yet ſuppoſing that the Pope not ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, that is, in regard of the ſpirituall good, hath not authoritie to diſpoſe of the temporals of Princes, and to depriue them of their kingdomes and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which of neceſſitie muſt be ſuppoſed at the leaſt as probable by him, who will take the oath: this, I ſay, ſuppoſed, <hi>it is anſwered,</hi> that any man may lawfullie thinke, and ſafely perſwade his conſcience, and this his opinion, or perſwaſion confirme by oath, that the Pope hath not power to abſolue him from his oath, that is, from the ſacred and religious obligation thereof. For, according to the common opinion of Diuines, the Pope hath not power to abſolue from oaths, when the abſoluing from them tendeth to the temporall preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of a third perſon, vnleſſe either directly, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly he hath power to diſpoſe of the temporall goods of that perſons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>From hence,</hi> ſaith Dominicus <hi>Sotus</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Lib. 8. de Iuſt. q. 1. ar. 9.</note>, a moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuine of the Order of S. <hi>Dominicke, doe ariſe two other differences to bee conſidered in the dispenſing of vowes and oaths. The firſt concerning thoſe perſons, who haue power to diſpenſe. For, although the Pope can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in a vow, which is greater, yet he cannot in an oath, which is leſſe. For he hath not power to releaſe an oath, which one hath made to another man, to pay him that debt which he oweth him. Neither doth this proceed from the leſſe power of the Pope, neither from the worthineſſe of the oath, but from the nature of the contract, which by oath is confirmed. For, becauſe the Pope is the Vicar of God, he hath power to change the vow, which is made to God, into that, which is more acceptable vnto him. But
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:489:86"/>
becauſe he hath not power to take from another man that which is his owne, hee cannot doe him wrong in releaſing the oath, which was made vnto him. And contrariwiſe, although a priuate man cannot diſpenſe in a vow, which is made to God, for that he is not his Vicar, yet he, to whom an oath was made, hath power to releaſe the ſame; not for that he hath more ample power, then the Pope, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Lord of his owne goods, and therefore as hee hath power to giue them ſo alſo hath he power to releaſe the oath made vnto him concerning them. Wherefore this is not a diſpenſing, but a remitting, or releaſing. The ſecond difference is concerning the matter; that in changing and diſpenſing of vowes that only muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, which is more pleaſing to God, but in releaſing of oaths great caution muſt be vſed that no wrong bee done to a third perſon. Hitherto Sotus,</hi> from whom <hi>Petrus Aragona</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">22. q. 89. ar. 9.</note>, and our countriman <hi>Gregorius Sayrus</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Lib 5. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauri cap. 8. nu. 4.</note> haue taken the ſelfeſame words.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seeing therefore, as oftentimes hath been ſaid, that the Pope hath not power to depriue our King, or to diſpoſe of his temporals, or of his ſubiects, from this ſuppoſall it doth euidently follow, that he hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to abſolue his ſubiects from this oath, which they haue taken for the performance of thoſe three things before<note n="b" place="margin">In this chapt. ſect. 1. nu. 9.</note> rehearſed, which euery ſubiect by the law of God and nature is obliged to performe. And truly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the probable doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his followers, who are of opinion, that the Pope, when hee diſpenſeth in vowes, and oaths, doth not diſſolue the ſacred and religious bond of the oath, (<hi>in that manner as many,</hi> ſaith <hi>Maldonate, doe vnderstand diſpenſation; for ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſhould diſanull, and altogether looſe the law of God and nature, as commonly it is done in many diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which is not to be a diſpenſator, but a diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>) but doth only interprete the oath, to wit, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the thing promiſed by oath, which before was a fit thing to be ſworne, and therefore by vertue of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:489:86"/>
the oath to be performed, ſo long as it remaineth ſo, is now by reaſon of ſome particular euent or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance become hurtfull, and an hindrance of a greater good, and therefore now no fit matter to be ſworne, nor by vertue of the oath to be now any more perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: According, I ſay, to this doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> which is alſo the more common of Diuines, it is plaine enough, that this obiection of our countrimen, taken from the difference betwixt the ſacred and ciuill bond of the oath, is of no force at all.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For whereas thoſe three things before rehearſed, which by the law of God and nature are due to lawfull Princes (whereof only there can be made any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie concerning the Popes power to abſolue from this oath, conſidering that all the other parts of the oath are meerely <hi>aſſertorie,</hi> neither are they ſubiect to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or diſpenſation) are only in this oath promiſed to be performed by the ſubiects; as the precepts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſame circumſtances remaining, are immutable and indiſpenſable, neither can God and nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an vnlawfull or hurtfull thing, or which is an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to greater good, ſo in thoſe three things, which, according to the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes related, are due by the law of God and nature to lawfull Princes, no interpretation or diſpenſation can be made. Neither can the Pope abſolue from this oath of allegiance, vnleſſe hee doe withall declare, that our allegiance, which is due to the King by the law of God and nature, be vnlawfull, hurtfull, or an hindrance to greater good, which hee cannot in any wiſe declare, vnleſſe hee hath power to make a King no King. For conſequently he ſhould alſo declare, that God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commanding ſubiects to beare true faith and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their lawfull Prince, ſhould inioine them an vnlawfull or hurtfull thing, or which is an hindrance to greater good. It is plaine therefore that, according to the common doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his Schoole,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:489:87"/>
the Pope cannot abſolue from the ſacred and religious bond <hi>of this oath</hi> of allegiance, vnleſſe alſo he doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the natural bond of our allegiance be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hurtfull, or an hindrance to greater good; that hereby it may eaſily appeare, how weake is this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our countrimen to condemne this branch of the oath as vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now concerning the two cauſes alleaged in the obiection, for which an abſolution, or diſpenſation in an oath may be demanded, or granted by the Pope, to wit, either to puniſh him to whom the oath was made, or when the oath was extorted through feare; <hi>it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> that both theſe cauſes be ſufficient, to moue the Pope to diſpenſe in thoſe oaths, <hi>wherein he hath power to dispenſe.</hi> I ſay, <hi>wherein hee hath power to dispenſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as I inſinuated a little before<note n="c" place="margin">Sect. 2. nu. 8.</note>, there is a great difference betwixt the Popes power to diſpenſe in a vow, or oath, and a ſufficient and iuſt cauſe for which he may diſpenſe therein. For a iuſt and lawfull cauſe to grant a diſpenſation, doth ſuppoſe in the Pope a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but doth not giue him a power to diſpence. And therefore if the Pope hath no authoritie giuen him by Chriſt to diſpenſe, for example ſake, in the ſolemne vow of chaſtitie (whereof, notwithſtanding many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Popes, who haue diſpenſed therein, there is a great controuerſie among Diuines euen to this day) then no vrgent cauſe whatſoeuer, as the preſeruing of a kingdome from eminent danger of ſome notable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or ſpirituall harme, can giue a true and reall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the Pope to diſpenſe in this vow.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wherefore when Diuines doe affirme, that one ſufficient cauſe, why the Pope may diſpenſe in an oath made to a third perſon, is to puniſh that third perſon, this their aſſertion is to bee vnderſtood of ſuch third perſons, vpon whom he hath authoritie to inflict ſuch a puniſhment. For otherwiſe a iuſt cauſe to abſolue from an oath, doth, as wee now haue ſaid, ſuppoſe in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:489:87"/>
Pope a power to abſolue, but doth not giue him ſuch a power. And ſo the Pope hath authoritie to abſolue ſubiects vpon a iuſt cauſe from their allegiance, which they owe to that Prince, ouer whom the Pope hath temporall iuriſdiction, becauſe hee hath authoritie to puniſh ſuch a Prince, if hee deſerue it, of whom he is a temporall Lord, with temporall puniſhment: But the Pope hath no authoritie to abſolue ſubiects from their temporall allegiance, which they owe to Soueraigne Princes, who in temporals acknowledge no Superiour beſide God, vnleſſe either directly, or indirectly he hath power to depriue ſuch Princes, and of Princes to make them no Princes, which as yet neither Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> nor any other hath ſufficiently proued.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. In like manner when Diuines affirme, that one ſufficient cauſe, for which the Pope hath power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue from an oath, is, if that oath be extorted through feare, this their aſſertion is to bee vnderſtood of ſuch oaths, which are wrongfully extorted, as if one, for feare of death, ſhould ſweare to giue a theefe a certaine ſumme of money: for to abſolue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch kind of oaths is iniurious to no man; but it is not to be vnderſtood of ſuch oaths, which are commanded by a iuſt law, and a great puniſhment impoſed vpon the infringers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If therefore this oath of allegiance, and the law, which commandeth it, be lawfull, and containe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, whereof there is now a controuerſie, and the contrarie hath not hitherto been ſufficiently proued, the feare of incurring the penaltie appointed by the law againſt the infringers thereof, is not a ſufficient cauſe, for which the Pope may diſpenſe euen in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred obligation thereof. For otherwiſe euery oath of allegiance, though it be in all mens opinion neuer ſo iuſt and lawfull, if it be commanded by the Prince his law, and a ſeuere puniſhment impoſed vpon the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof, may be ſaid to be extorted through feare, and that the Pope in regard of this feare may abſolue
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:489:88"/>
the ſubiects from ſuch an oath, which no Catholikes, no not our aduerſaries themſelues, dare, as I ſuppoſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to auerre.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to thoſe three texts of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> mentioned in the obiection, which ſeeme to proue, that the Pope hath power to abſolue ſubiects from their oath of allegiance, we <hi>anſwere,</hi> that the firſt canon, <hi>Nos ſanctorum,</hi> is a decree of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7, wherein <hi>by Apoſtolicall authoritie he abſolueth thoſe, who either by allegiance, or oath, are obliged to excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and moſt ſtreightly commandeth, that they doe them no loialtie, vntill they make ſatisfaction.</hi> The ſecond ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>Iuratos milites,</hi> is of Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the ſecond, who was next Succeſſor to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> after <hi>Victor</hi> the 3, who reigned but ſixe moneths, wherein <hi>he commanded the Biſhop Vapicenſis to forbid the ſworne ſouldiers to Count Hugo, to ſerue him ſo long, as he remained excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. Who if they ſhall pretend their oathes, let them be admoniſhed, that they ought rather to ſerue God, then men. For by no authority they are bound to performe their allegiance which they haue ſworne to a Chriſtian Prince, who is contrarie to God and his Saints, and contemneth their commandements.</hi> The third canon, <hi>Abſolutos,</hi> is of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth, wherein <hi>he declareth, that all thoſe, who are obliged to manifeſt heretikes, by any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant ſtrengthened with neuer ſo great ſecuritie, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from the bond of all allegiance, homage, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. But theſe <hi>Canons</hi> are not forcible to proue, that the Pope hath power to abſolue ſubiects from their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, which by the law of God and nature they owe to Soueraigne Princes, who in temporals acknowledge no Superiour vpon earth. And firſt, if they were of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force, they would euidently proue, that the Pope hath power to abſolue, not only from the ſacred bond of the oath of allegiance, but alſo from the natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation thereof: and therefore they auaile nothing to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:489:88"/>
confirme our countrimens obiection, who endeuour to proue, that the Pope hath power to abſolue from the ſacred bond of the oath of allegiance, without releaſing the naturall obligation thereof.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> neither doe theſe <hi>Canons</hi> make any mention of abſolute and Soueraigne Princes, who, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be ſpecified by name are not to bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in penall lawes: and therefore either they haue force onely to binde in the territories of the Church, whereof the Pope is Soueraigne Lord in temporals, who therefore hath authoritie to enioyne a temporall puniſhment, to which all Princes, who bee his Vaſſals, ſhall alſo be ſubiect: (For out of the temporall domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Church the Pope hath not authoritie in meere temporall cauſes, as is the diſpoſing, I doe not ſay, the directing of temporall things for the ſpirituall good, to enact lawes, which ſhall binde abſolute and Soueraigne Princes, who are not ſubiect vnto him in temporals: as by the like reaſon may be euidently ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the doctrine of <hi>Franciſcus Suarez</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:489:89"/>
                     <hi>Canons,</hi> they muſt of neceſſitie acknowledge, which yet I thinke they dare ſcarcely affirme, that <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> ſo ſoone as they either for hereſie, or any other crime, doe incurre into the generall <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the Church, are preſently without any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or ſentence of depriuation depriued in very deede of their Regall authoritie, which is both againſt the continuall practiſe, which Popes do vſe in depoſing of <hi>Princes,</hi> and is alſo repugnant to the common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all men.</p>

                     <hi>Suarez</hi> and others doe accord, <hi>is agreeable to the Canon, and Ciuill law;</hi> to wit, that a Law both Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and Ciuill, although it be enacted by lawfull authority, and rightly proclaimed, is not of force vnleſſe by cuſtome it be receiued.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And ſo the <hi>Kingdome</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelats</hi> of <hi>France</hi> would not receiue certaine decrees of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which was that before<note n="p" place="margin">Cap 3. ſec. 3. nu. 13.</note> rehearſed, wherin <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes were forbidden to permit ſingle combate vnder paine of forfeiting the City, or place where by their ſufferance it was fought. <hi>This article,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authority of the King, who cannot be depriued of his temporal dominion, in regard whereof he acknowledgeth no Superiour at all.</hi>

                  <p n="27">27. And truly in my opinion thoſe <hi>Prelats</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who apprehended that the aforeſaid decree of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> did conteine not onely Princes, who were feuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Church, but alſo abſolute, and <hi>Soueraigne</hi> Princes, as is the <hi>King</hi> of France, (in which ſenſe alſo many others vnderſtand this place) would not for theſe cauſes receiue that decree, either for that they thought it was enacted not abſolutely, but vpon preſumption, and hope that Princes would ratifie the ſame, and ſo conditionally if Princes would giue their conſent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; or which I iudge to be more probable, for that they ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Councell</hi> in making that decree, did relye onely vpon a probable opinion, concerning the authoritie of the ſpirituall power to diſpoſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls for the ſpirituall good, which opinion, ſith that it is onely probable, and might tend to the great preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>King</hi> of France, and of other <hi>Princes,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> of France were not bound to follow.

that, according to all Diuines, and Lawyers, although their may perchance, ſome fault be committed by them who at the firſt doe not receiue the decree of a <hi>Councell</hi> after it bee lawfully proclaimed, yet afterwards it hath no force to bind, if either by ſufferance or contrary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome not puniſhed it be not obſerued.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection ſuppoſing that, according to the rules before related out of <hi>Suarez,</hi> the true and common meaning of the words of any law is to bee gathered from the circumſtances,<note place="margin">Cap. 1. ſec. 2. et ſeq.</note> the end of the Law, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the intention of the Lawmaker, it is anſwered <hi>firſt,</hi> that whenſoeuer a Law doth bind in generall words all perſons whatſoeuer to obſerue the ſame, thoſe words are in common ſpeech to be vnderſtood only of ſuch perſons, which are ſubiect to the Law-maker, and not of other perſons, who are not ſubiect to him; nor of the Law-maker himſelfe, for that, according to the moſt certaine, and approoued rule of all Diuines, and Lawyers, the power of commanding, or Lawmaking, is in a Superiour towards his inferiour, and conſequently not towards himſelfe, or his equall. In like manner alſo when any law in generall words affirmeth, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoeuer hath power to diſpenſe at any time in that Law, or to abſolue any man from the bond therof, thoſe words are in common ſpeech onely to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of thoſe perſons, who are inferiour to the Law-maker, and not of the Lawmaker himſelfe, or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, who is of equall authority with him. For both theſe, as they haue authority to make the Law, and alſo to repeale the ſame, ſo alſo according to the common vnderſtanding of men they haue authority to diſpenſe in the ſame, or to abſolue any man from the obligation thereof. Whereupon very well ſaid <hi>Salas</hi> before<note n="t" place="margin">cap. 1. ſec. 3. nu. 4.</note> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in a generall ſpeech the perſon, who ſpeaketh, is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be excepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherfore in this oath of allegiance, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his maieſties Law, thoſe words <hi>[nor any perſon whatſoeuer hath power to abſolue me of this oath]</hi> ought in common ſpeech to bee vnderſtood in this manner, that no perſon except the King himſelfe hath power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this oath. For otherwiſe if thoſe words <hi>[nor any perſon whatſoeuer]</hi> were to bee vnderſtood in their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:489:94"/>
whole generality without any exception, from thence it might rightly be inferred, that by vertue of this clauſe we are bound to ſweare, that no perſon either humane, or deuine hath power to abſolue me from this oath, or any part thereof; And yet, according to the approoued doctrine of all Lawyers, whenſoeuer the words of a law doe ſound in ſuch ſort that they may be taken in a good or euill ſenſe, they ought to be applyed to that ſenſe, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe it bee improper) wherein the Law containeth no iniuſtice, or abſurdity; for this is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the intention of the Lawmaker, whoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to make a true Law, whereas an vniuſt, abſurd, or vnreaſonable Law is to bee accounted no true Law. Whereupon <hi>in a doubtfull word of the Law,</hi> ſaith the law:<note n="u" place="margin">Leg. <hi>in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua</hi> F. de legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> 
                     <hi>That ſenſe is rather to be taken, which is not faulty, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing that thereby the meaning alſo of the Law may be gathered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if we will interpret all the words of this oath, in ſuch rigorous a manner, as theſe ſeuere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours doe wreſt them, it is alſo lawfull to ſweare, that as the King alone without the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath not, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſuall cuſtome of this Realme,</hi> power to enact Lawes, ſo alſo neither hath he alone without the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> power to abſolue from the Lawes, but this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appertaineth onely to the Law-maker, who is the <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Parliament</hi> together. The penalty impoſed by the Law doubtleſſe he may remit, but the Law it ſelfe according to the cuſtome of this Realme he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull. And ſo he hath power to abſolue thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> from the puniſhment appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law, but from the obligation to performe thoſe things, which one hath promiſed by this <hi>Oath,</hi> he together with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or rather neither hee, nor the Parliament, as ſhall appeare beneath,<note n="x" place="margin">nu. 6. and. 7.</note> hath power to abſolue. Now by theſe words, <hi>nor any perſon whatſoeuer,</hi> are properly vnderſtood onely ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not a community, or <hi>Parliament.</hi> As the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:489:95"/>
Diuines of <hi>Paris</hi> doe in this ſort expound thoſe words, <hi>The firſt See is iudged by no man,</hi> to wit, that no particular perſon hath power to iudge the firſt <hi>See,</hi> which neuertheleſſe is no let, ſay they, but that a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell</hi> hath authority to iudge the firſt <hi>See.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I ſaid a little before <hi>[according to the vſuall cuſtome of this Realme]</hi> becauſe I doe not intend to affirme, or to deny any thing concerning his <hi>Maieſties</hi> abſolute power, and prerogatiue, but only to ſatisfie this preſent obiection I thought good brieflie to inſinuate what is the preſent cuſtome of this kingdom in the eſtabliſhing of lawes. But whether this cuſtome did firſt proceede from the Kings free grant, or from the common wealth limiting the <hi>Regall</hi> authority, I leaue to others to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe. It may onely at this preſent ſuffice to rehearſe, what <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> in his Chronicle hath written in this matter.<note n="y" place="margin">In the life of K.

                     <hi>This yeare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Stow, on the ninteenth day of Aprill K.</hi> Henry <hi>called a Councell of the States of this Realme, both of the Prelates, Nobles and Commons to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury, there to conſult for the good gouernment of the Common Wealth, and the waighty affaires of the ſame, which Councell, taking the name, and Fame of the French, is called Parliament. And this doe the Hiſtoriographers note to bee the firſt Parliament in England, and that the Kings before that time were neuer wont to call any of their commons, or people to Councell, or Law-making, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is euident, that thoſe, who doe ſo much inſiſt vpon this obiection, do ſeeke rather to cauil, then really to except againſt this clauſe. For that according to the common opinion of them, who are ſo vehement againſt this <hi>Oath,</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> being a ſacred, and ſpirituall bond, it belongeth onely to the ſpirituall power, as to Biſhops; to abſolue or diſpenſe therein, and to releaſe directly the ſpiritual obligation, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing theſe Doctors will haue diſpenſing, and abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from <hi>Oaths</hi> properly to conſiſt. Therefore if wee will ſpeake properly and according to the common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:489:95"/>
of thoſe, who doe vrge this obiection, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>King</hi> himſelfe, according to their doctrine, hath power to abſolue from this oath, that is, hath power to releaſe directly the ſpirituall obligation therof. He may indeed releaſe an <hi>oath</hi> made vnto him, by taking away the matter of the <hi>oath,</hi> as Parents may with the <hi>oaths</hi> of their Children, a Gardian with the <hi>oaths</hi> of his Ward, an Abbot with the <hi>oaths</hi> of his Monkes, and euery priuate man may remit an <hi>oath</hi> made vnto him; but to diſpenſe in <hi>oaths,</hi> or to abſolue from them (taking diſpenſation, and abſolution in that ſenſe, wherein theſe impugners of the <hi>oath</hi> doe take them) no temporall power hath authoritie. Wherefore the Diuines doe make a great diſtinction betwixt diſpenſing, and abſoluing from an <hi>oath,</hi> and betwixt annulling, or releaſing of the ſame, and doe affirme, that to annull, and releaſe an <hi>oath,</hi> a temporall power may ſuffice, but to abſolue, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe therein, a ſpirituall iuriſdiction is of neceſſitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſuppoſing that the common meaning of theſe words, <hi>[to abſolue me from this oath]</hi> is not to diſpenſe with me, that I ſhall not take this <hi>oath,</hi> but to abſolue me from the obligation of performing thoſe things, which I haue ſworne to performe, it may alſo be anſwered, that although it were granted, that the <hi>King</hi> hath power to abſolue me from the bond of taking this <hi>oath,</hi> yet neither the <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Parliament</hi> hath power to abſolue me from this <hi>oath</hi> once taken, or which is all one, can giue me leaue not to performe thoſe things, which I haue by this <hi>oath</hi> promiſed to performe. And the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe there bee three only things, as I haue ſaid before<note n="z" place="margin">In this chapt. ſect. 1. nu. 9.</note>, contained in this <hi>oath,</hi> which the ſwearer promiſeth to performe, to wit, <hi>to beare faith, and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, to defend him from all Treaſons, and to diſcloſe them, when they come to his knowledge;</hi> but all theſe are by the law of God and nature commanded to ſubiects, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:489:96"/>
the <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Parliament</hi> hath power to abſolue me from the performing of the aforeſaid three things; or which is all one, can giue me leaue not to beare true allegiance to his Maieſtie, not to defend him againſt treaſons, and not to diſcloſe them, when thereby great danger to his perſon or State may ariſe, ſeeing that they haue no power to abſolue me from the obligation of the law of God and nature.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe fifth, and laſt obiection, which is inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Antonius Capellus,</hi> is againſt thoſe firſt words of this branch, <hi>I beleeue, and in conſcience am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that neither the Pope, &amp;c.</hi> which words <hi>do ſeeme to ſignifie a diuine, and ſupernaturall beliefe, with which beliefe nothing ought to be beleeued, but that, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as moſt certaine by the Catholike Church; but that the Pope</hi> hath not power to abſolue me from this <hi>oath,</hi> doth not appertaine to the Catholike faith, but rather the contrarie, (if we will giue credit to Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Gretzer, and Leſſius) doth belong to faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot without periurie ſweare, that the Pope hath not power to abſolue me from this oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection it is anſwered, by denying, that this word, <hi>I beleeue,</hi> is taken in this branch for ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall beliefe, but only for morall credulitie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, whereof in common ſpeech it is vſually vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And this partly may ſufficiently appeare by the whole ſcope and tenour of the <hi>oath,</hi> wherein is onely exacted of vs a true and ſincere teſtification, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, and declaration, how in our conſciences we are perſwaded <hi>concerning the Popes authoritie to depoſe our King, to diſpoſe of his dominions, to diſcharge his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of their obedience, and to abſolue them from this oath, &amp;c.</hi> partly it is manifeſt by the words following, <hi>[and in conſcience I am reſolued]</hi> which are a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:489:96"/>
of the former, and which were altogether ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly, and vainly added, if they ſhould import leſſe, then the word, <hi>I beleeue;</hi> euen as one ſhould ſay, <hi>he is a man, and a ſenſible creature, I know it moſt certainly, and alſo I thinke it to be ſo.</hi> For as, according to our Engliſh phraſe, <hi>not to be reſolued in conſcience</hi> to ſay, or doe any thing, doth at the moſt ſignifie an inclination of the minde to ſay, or doe that thing mixt with ſome waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or doubt of the contrarie, but not a full aſſent, or perſwaſion thereunto; ſo <hi>to be reſolued in conſcience</hi> to embrace ſuch a doctrine, importeth onely a full aſſent, and approbation of that doctrine, which approbation only requireth a <hi>moral credulity,</hi> and not a <hi>ſupernatural beliefe,</hi> or a cleere demonſtration of that doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Moreouer,</hi> whenſoeuer any word contained in a law hath a doubtfull and ambiguous ſignification, to know in what ſenſe it ought to bee taken, many rules are aſſigned by the Lawyers, concerning which, as wee haue ſaid before,<note n="*" place="margin">cap. 1. ſec. 2.</note> the end, and matter of the law, the circumſtances precedent, and following, and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law-maker are to bee conſidered. The end of this <hi>oath,</hi> eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Kings</hi> law, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>Preamble</hi> thereof, as the ends of all lawes are vſually expreſſed, is <hi>to make triall how his Maiesties ſubiects ſtand affected in point of their loyaltie, and due obedience,</hi> which their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſufficiently be made knowne by a <hi>morall credulitie,</hi> to wit, if they beleeue, and without any doubt perſwade themſelues, or, which is al one, are reſolued in their conſciences, and this their ſincere credulitie, perſwaſion, and reſolution they doe confirme by <hi>oath,</hi> that the Pope hath not power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>King,</hi> to diſcharge his ſubiects of their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to abſolue them of this <hi>oath,</hi> or any part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp;c. The matter, or thing, which in this branch of the <hi>oath</hi> we are compelled to <hi>beleeue,</hi> to wit, <hi>that the Pope hath not power to abſolue me from this oath, or any part thereof,</hi> doth not appertaine to the Catholike beliefe,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:489:97"/>
but that among Catholikes there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> knew very well. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the certaine, and approued rule of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting lawes, it is alwaies to be preſumed, vnleſſe the contrarie doe cleerely appeare, that the Law-maker did not intend to binde vs by <hi>oath,</hi> to <hi>beleeue</hi> that with <hi>ſupernaturall faith,</hi> which with that <hi>faith</hi> is not to bee <hi>beleeued,</hi> but that he only deſired this, that hee might be aſſured of our ſincere perſwaſion, and firme reſolution concerning this clauſe of the <hi>oath.</hi> Which general rule, to wit, that wee muſt not, if it may bee, interprete the words of the law in an abſurd, or vnlawfull ſenſe, all Diuines and Lawyers doe ſo vnderſtand, that if the words of the law, being taken in their proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do containe any vnlawfull, or inconuenient thing, they ought to be transferred to an improper, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall ſenſe, becauſe it ought alwaies to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as much as may be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lawmaker did not inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to binde vs to any vnlawfull thing. And truly, if thoſe, who ſo vehemently impugne the <hi>oath,</hi> had diligently, and dutifully conſidered this rule, they might doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe haue made a more fauourable conſtruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words contained in this <hi>oath,</hi> againſt which it is too too manifeſt, that with more rigour, then is fitting, and with leſſer ſoliditie, then beſeemeth ſo excellently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, they haue excepted.</p>

we before<note n="b" place="margin">Cap 4 ſect. 1. nu. 1.</note> out of his Engliſh <hi>Recapitulator</hi> haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And to the ſame effect are thoſe foure arguments of <hi>Gretzer</hi>

                  <p>For his firſt argument is, <hi>that in this oath is denied, that the Pope hath any iuriſdiction ouer the Churches of England, Scotland, Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>that therein is affirmed, that King Iames, and not the Pope is the ſupreme head of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in great Britannie, euen in Eccleſiaſticall, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall cauſes.</hi>

                     <hi>that therein is alſo denied, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Paſtor of the Vniuerſall Church hath power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine, and puniſh wolues, who with rauening mouths doe aſſault, diſperſe, and deſtroy the flocke of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> his fourth argument is,<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 105.</note> that in this <hi>oath</hi> is affirmed, <hi>that King Iames is vniuerſally without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to be obeyed in all things, which he attempteth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ioyned with the ouerthrow of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Catholike religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And truly if theſe aſſertions were contained in this <hi>oath,</hi> as <hi>Gretzer</hi> ouer confidently, to ſay no more, doth affirme, no man doubtleſſe could denie, but that this <hi>oath,</hi> as impious, ſacrilegious, and cleerely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Catholike faith, ought to be condemned by all Catholikes. But, fie for ſhame, theſe his foure moſt falſe aſſertions he deduceth from principles partly cleerely falſe, and partly greatly controuerted, and which, if they were freely granted him, were not ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre theſe his foure propoſitions. To wit, <hi>becauſe in this oath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is affirmed, that the Pope hath no iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all in any caſe ouer the king, or his ſubiects, ſo that he can neither depoſe, nor excommunicate the King, nor abſolue his ſubiects from the bond of their allegiance, nor binde them to obey a iuſt Excommunication, whatſoeuer
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:489:98"/>
at all he doth to the preiudice, yea and ouerthrow of the Catholike, and truly Chriſtian, and Apoſtolike faith. For this is the expreſſe intention of the oath, neither can it euer be ſo ſhadowed with any colourable ſhew of words, but that it may cleerely appeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Truly I cannot wonder enough at the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full boldnes of this man, otherwiſe learned, who with ſuch confidence, &amp; with ſo great vehemencie of words is not afraid to auouch things, which are ſo euidently falſe. For <hi>this oath</hi> doth not affirme, as we haue ſhewed before<note n="f" place="margin">Cap. 4. ſect. 1.</note>, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>King,</hi> or that the Subiects are not bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey a iuſt <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and much leſſe, that they may lawfully contemne it, as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith; betwixt which two, to wit, not to obey a iuſt excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and to contemne it, a great difference is to be made. But the <hi>oath</hi> doth onely affirme this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>King</hi> be excommunicated, yet hee is to bee obeyed in ciuill matters, for that <hi>Excommunication,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a ſpirituall Cenſure, hath not force to depriue Princes of their temporall kingdomes, and dominions, or, which is all one, of their Regall authoritie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not to take away the temporall obedience, which is due to Princes by the law of God and nature. Beſides this it alſo affirmeth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to depriue Princes, and therefore neither to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge Subiects of their allegiance, or to abſolue any man from this <hi>oath;</hi> But this is not to denie the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, as wee haue partly here before<note n="g" place="margin">Cap. 3. &amp; 6.</note>, partly in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places<note n="h" place="margin">In Apolog. &amp; Reſponſ Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.</note>, and partly hereafter<note n="i" place="margin">Againſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Schulcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
                     </note> will more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondly, Gretzer</hi> in all his foure arguments doth cunningly ioyne <hi>depoſition</hi> with <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as though whoſoeuer denieth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Kings, is conſequently bound to denie, that he alſo hath power to excommunicate Kings, which <hi>Leſſius,</hi> as wee haue ſeene before<note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 4. ſect. 1. nu. 1. &amp; 7.</note>, doth ouer boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:489:99"/>
whereas many very learned Diuines, and two alſo very famous Ieſuites, <hi>Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Becanus,</hi> doe in plaine words teach the contrarie, and moreouer many Catholikes, who, although they dare not deny the <hi>Popes</hi> power to excommunicate Kings, yet they are not afraid to deny his power to depoſe Princes, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue ſubiects from their allegiance. And truly in my opinion it is greatly to be wondred at, that men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo excellently learned, in matters of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as to eſtabliſh new articles of faith, and to withdraw faithfull ſubiects from taking an <hi>oath</hi> of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and that to the perpetuall temporall ouerthrow of themſelues, and their whole poſteritie, ſhould not be fearefull to bring ſuch exorbitant, paradoxicall, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall arguments, which to euery man but meanely learned doe euidently ſeeme to bee moſt weake, in ſo much that our countrimen, who doe not diſallow the <hi>oath,</hi> are thereby rather confirmed in their opinion, and thoſe, who diſallow it, and are very deſirous to deuiſe ſome ſolid argument, which they may obiect againſt it, to ſee ſuch childiſh collections, I ſpeake with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, are greatly aſhamed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For what man is there of ſo meane vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who at the firſt fight cannot perceiue the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe inferences?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In this oath is denied the Popes power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and depoſe the King; therefore in this oath is denied, that the Pope hath no iuriſdiction, euen ſpirituall, ouer the Churches of England, Scotland, Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>in this oath is affirmed, that the King cannot be excommunicated, that he cannot be depoſed: therefore therein is affirmed, that King Iames, and not the Pope is the ſupreme head of the Chriſtians in great Britannie, euen in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>in this oath is denied, that the King can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, that he can be depoſed: therefore therein is denied, that the vniuerſall Paſtor of the Church hath
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:489:99"/>
power to reſtraine, and puniſh hereticall Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>in this oath is affirmed, that the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excommunicated, that he cannot bee depoſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this oath is affirmed that King Iames muſt vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally without exception be obeyed in all things, which he doth attempt, although they be ioyned with the ouerthrow of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. For all the antecedent propoſitions, forſomuch as appertaineth to the power of <hi>excommunicating,</hi> are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, as we before againſt Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> haue manifeſtly proued. And if they were only vnderſtood of the power of depoſing (beſides that this power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing cannot be certainely confirmed with any ſolide proofe) it is alſo too too apparant, that the conſequents are not rightly inferred from the antecedents. For in <hi>Gretzers</hi> firſt argument the conſequent can no waies be deduced from the antecedent. For although one ſhould auerre, that by the peculiar priuiledge of <hi>God Kings</hi> are exempted from the coerciue power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet from thence it would not follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had no ſpirituall iuriſdiction ouer any of the <hi>Kings</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. For the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot excommunicate an infidell Prince, neuertheleſſe he hath ſpirituall Iuriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Chriſtians, who are ſubiect to that Prince. How much the more will this inference be inſufficient, if we ſpeake onely of the Popes power to depoſe a Prince? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the conſequence alſo of the ſecond argument is no leſſe falſe, eſpecially if the antecedent propoſition be vnderſtood of the power to depoſe. And although we ſhould grant, that the antecedent propoſition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo the <hi>Popes</hi> power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate were true, yet it is not from thence rightly inferred, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>King,</hi> &amp; not the <hi>Pope,</hi> is ſupream head of the Chriſtians in great Britannie, euen in ſpirituall cauſes, as appeareth alſo in Heathen Princes, who cannot be excommunicated, and yet the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Supreame Paſtour in ſpirituall cauſes of all the faithfull, who are ſubiects in their dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:489:100"/>
                     <hi>Furthermore,</hi> in the <hi>third</hi> argument the antecedent propoſition, for ſo much as concerneth the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe, doth not rightly infer the conſequent: for it is a fallacious arguing from a particular to an vniuerſall. As, for example, the Pope cannot puniſh Kings with this puniſhment, therfore he cannot puniſh <hi>Kings.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> may indeede, according to Catholike doctrine, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh hereticall <hi>Kings</hi> with ſpirituall puniſhments, but whether he hath power to puniſh them with temporall puniſhments is the very queſtion which is now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the conſequence of the <hi>fourth</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although wee ſhould grant both parts of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent propoſitions, is ſo euidently falſe, and abſurd, that I am almoſt aſhamed to repeat it, in ſo much that it is a wonder, how ſo learned a man did not greatlie bluſh to publiſh it to the whole Chriſtian world for proouing a thing of ſo great importance. I would willingly alſo, that <hi>Gretzer</hi> would ſincerely anſwere vs, whether the ſelfe-fame arguments, which hee hath framed againſt this oath, he might not alleage in the ſelfeſame tearmes againſt that doctrine of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Fraunce</hi> aboue<note n="l" place="margin">Cap. 3. ſect. 3. nu. 13.</note> related out of <hi>Petrus Pithaeus, that the Pope hath not power to depriue the King of France of his Kingdome, and notwithſtanding any excommunications, and ſo forth,</hi> to condemne it as flat hereticall, and containing a manifeſt denyall of the Catholicke faith,</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> others proue the aforeſaid <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition by this argument. <hi>To determine, and define what the Pope can do, or cannot do in ſpiritual cauſes, what power he hath to depoſe Princes, to diſcharge Subiects of their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and to abſolue from oaths, what force Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath, and what effect it worketh, &amp; to conclude, what poſition is hereticall, or not heretical, are all ſpirituall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but the King doth in this oath determine, &amp; define all the aforeſaid things, therefore many ſpirituall matters are contained in this oath.</hi> This argument is inſinuated by

that <hi>nameleſſe Doctor,</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. To this <hi>obiection</hi> it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> by denying alſo the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition. For the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> doe not determine, and define, what ſpirituall power <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord hath granted to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, but they knew right well, that there is a great controuerſie among Catholikes concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and to abſolue Subiects from the oath of their alleageance: and that ſome do affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge Subiects of their obedience, although it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by oath, and that others doe vtterly denye the ſame: that ſome alſo doe affirme, that <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if not directly, at the leaſt indirectly, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, hath this effect, to depriue <hi>Princes</hi> of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Iuriſdiction, and that others, with the greater, and better part of Diuines, doe vtterly denye the ſame. and becauſe the former opinion was neither in practiſe, nor ſpeculation knowne to the Primitiue Church (as far as wee may coniecture by the hiſtories of thoſe times) and beſides that it hath giuen no little occaſion of great tumults both in this Kingdome, and in other parts of the Chriſtian world, the King and Parliament, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the whole body of the common-wealth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member therof, thought it conuenient for preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of future tumults, and conſpiracies, which they thought otherwiſe would probably enſue, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion ſhould be followed, and embraced of al the <hi>Kings</hi> Subiects, and that therof a publicke, and ſincere profeſſion, teſtification, and declaration ſhould with a ſolemne oath be made by all men.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:489:101"/>
ſinne, neuertheleſſe they bound all the profeſſours of Diuinity vnder certain penalties proper to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, that they ſhould not publickely preach, nor teach, that ſhee had contracted originall ſinne, and yet they did not intend thereby to decide, and define that controuerſie, but onely to declare their great liking of the one opinion, and their great diſlike of the other.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> theſe, who do vrge this argument, wil ſcarcely, as I thinke, denye, that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may, to auoid probable dangers of future Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, compell all his <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſubiects, to profeſſe, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, acknowledge and declare by oath, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitution the direct Lord of this Kingdome, nor that our <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Popes</hi> Subiect, Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and Vicar in temporalls, and neuertheleſſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts doe ſo vehemently defend this direct dominion of the <hi>Pope</hi> in temporalls not only ouer this kingdome, but alſo ouer the vniuerſall Chriſtian world, that ſome of them<note n="r" place="margin">

Yet from hence it cannot rightly be gathered, that the King ſhould arrogate to himſelfe ſpiritual power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, what ſpirituall Iuriſdiction is by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And from hence it doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, <hi>that the deniall of that Papall power, which is a ſacred thing and giuen from aboue, and which no mortall man can take away or diminiſh is not denied in this oath,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">In Reſponſ. ad Apolog. p. 8.</note> doth vnworthily auerre; for this power is expreſly found in the word of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written or deliuered to the Church by tradition, or by euident conſequence deduced from thence, &amp; which therefore all Catholikes doe profeſſe to appertaine to the Catholike faith; but that only power of the <hi>Pope</hi> is denied in this <hi>oath,</hi> which without any preiudice of faith may by Catholikes be lawfully denied.

to make a ſincere declaration of their allegiance, either by a bare promiſe, or by <hi>oath,</hi> as the Prince ſhall pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently iudge to be more expedient for his ſafetie.

Whether by the King? But hee hath not power to conſecrate. Whether by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, or ſuch like? Neither that truely. For</hi> Thomas Cranmer, <hi>who vnder K. Henry the eight obtained the Archbiſhoprick of Canturbury, was not conſecrated by any Biſhop, but thruſt in violently, and deſigned onely by the King alone, Therefore as many as were afterwards conſecrated by him, were not conſecrated lawfully, but by preſumption.</hi>

faith, are very deſirous to flye to this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to wit, whether the Proteſtant <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome bee true, and Lawfull Biſhops or no. For at the leaſt by this way they thinke to demonſtrate, that in this <hi>oath</hi> is euidendy contained not onely ciuill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but alſo other things which appertaine to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, to wit, to the lawfull miniſtring of the Sacrament of <hi>holy Order.</hi> But with this Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, whether the Proteſtant <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this Kingdome haue true Ordination, and conſequently are true <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> or no; that is, whether from the beginning, and ſo ſucceſſiuely from time to time, they were ordained by true <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and whether thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> from time to time vſed that due forme, and matter, which by <hi>Christ</hi> his inſtitution is neceſſarily required to impreſſe the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall Character,</hi> conſidering that it is, both a queſtion of fact, wherof I haue not as yet any certain knowledge &amp; alſo altogether impertinent for the ſatisfying of this preſent obiection, I will not at this time intermeddle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet before I come to anſwere the obiection, I would haue the Reader to be forwarned of two things. The firſt is, that betwixt a true, and lawfull <hi>Biſhop</hi> there is a great difference to be made. For that one be a true <hi>Biſhop,</hi> it is onely required, that hee haue true <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby the <hi>Epiſcopall Character</hi> is impreſſed and which cannot be raſed out, but alwaies remaineth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he become a Turke, Iew, or hereticke. And ſo the <hi>Arrian Biſhops,</hi> although they were hereticks, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were truely ordained, they were alſo true <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> neither were they reordained, when they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the vnity of the Catholike Church. But that one be a lawfull <hi>Biſhop,</hi> beſides true <hi>Ordination</hi> is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary lawfull <hi>miſſion</hi> and <hi>Iuriſdiction,</hi> which by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitution is onely deriued from the true, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond is, that <hi>Becanus</hi> very raſhly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any probable colour of reaſon, or authority, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:489:107"/>
againſt the plaine records of this Kingdome doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was not conſecrated by any true <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> but deſigned onely by the <hi>King.</hi> For (beſides that King <hi>Henry</hi> at that time, when <hi>Cranmer</hi> was made <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> to wit, the twenty fourth yeare of his raigne, had not altogether renounced the communion of the <hi>See Apoſtolicke,</hi> by whoſe authorite both the election of <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the <hi>Archbiſhopricke</hi> was confirmed, and to whom alſo he, when he was conſecrated, ſwore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which afterwards his aduerſaries did caſt in his teeth; and therefore there can bee made no doubt, that he was conſecrated by other <hi>Biſhops</hi> with all rites, and ceremonies according to the ancient Canons) this onely argument may ſuffice to conuince <hi>Becanus,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> the very next yeare after, to wit, the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth yeare of his Raigne, made a Law in publick <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> that euery <hi>Archbiſhop, and Biſhop of this Realme ſhould be preſented and nominated by the Kings</hi> Maieſty, <hi>his heires, and ſucceſſors, but that he ſhould bee conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one</hi> Archbiſhop, <hi>and two</hi> Biſhops, <hi>or elſe by foure</hi> Biſhops <hi>appointed by the</hi> King, <hi>with all benedictions, and ceremonies required thereunto;</hi> which cuſtome in electing &amp; conſecrating <hi>Biſhops</hi> is vſed euen at this preſent time. For firſt the <hi>King</hi> ſendeth his letters to the Chapter of the vacant See, wherein hee granteth them leaue to chooſe a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and preſenteth vnto them one, or more to be elected, who being elected the <hi>King</hi> confirmeth the election, and afterwards hee ſendeth his letters to three <hi>Biſhops</hi> at the leaſt, requiring them to conſecrate him Biſhop. Wherefore I maruell from whom <hi>Beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a man otherwiſe very learned, hath taken this ſo manifeſt a fiction, ſeeing that it is not credible, that hee hath deuiſed it out of his owne braine.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe therefore beeing premoniſhed, for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this preſent <hi>obiection</hi> foure things are to bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that the cuſtome, which any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath to enact no lawes without the counſell, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:489:107"/>
conſent of the three States of the Realme, did originally proceede either from the <hi>King</hi> alone, who, to gouerne his Subiects more quietly, and peaceably, did freely, and of his owne accord grant them this Priuiledge, that hee would enact no lawes without the counſell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the three States of the Realme: or it had it firſt beginning from the whole common-wealth, which at the firſt, when it was ſubiect to no <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince, but the <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> or ſupreame power to rule was in it ſelfe, did chooſe their <hi>King</hi> with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and limitation, that he ſhould not haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make lawes, vnleſſe the whole common-wealth, which the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth repreſent, ſhould alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with him: But then we muſt of neceſſity confeſſe, that <hi>King</hi> not to be altogether an abſolute Prince, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he hath not power to make lawes, which all abſolute Princes, according to the Doctrine of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and Lawyers doubtleſſe haue: or <hi>laſtly</hi> it was firſt deriued both from the <hi>King</hi> and Common-wealth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reaſon of ſome couenant agreed on betwixt them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>ſecond Suppoſition</hi> is, that no humane law hath ſo ſtrong force to binde, but that the Law-maker, or his Suceſſor, who hath equall authoritie with him, hath power to repeale, and diſanull the ſame. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Law-maker may perchance greatly offend by repealing without iuſt cauſe a good, and profitable law, yet all Doctors doe with vniforme conſent agree in this, that the abrogating thereof is valide, and that the aforeſaid law hath no longer any force to binde. And the reaſon hereof they alleage, for that euery thing is by the ſame cauſes diſſolued, by which it is made, but the will of the Law-maker, intending to binde his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects by his law, being the principall cauſe, yea and the ſoule of the law it ſelfe, may bee altered, and reuoked at his pleaſure: And ſo the law is ſo long, and no longer a law, then the Law-maker, or his Succeſſor will haue it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:489:108"/>
to be a law: Neither is it in the power of the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſo to tye his Succeſſor, but that he hath alwaies free power, to abrogate the law, when he ſhall pleaſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that no leſſe true, then vulgar ſaying, <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium: No man hath authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his equall.</hi> For the Succeſſor to the Prince hath not authoritie to make lawes from the perſon of the Prince, whom hee ſucceedeth, but from the office, wherein hee ſucceedeth him. And what wee haue ſaid concerning the repealing of lawes, the ſame alſo is proportionably to bee vnderſtood of the reuoking of couenants, and contracts, to wit, that euery couenant, or contract, may by the mutuall conſent of both parties bee either in ſome part altered, or elſe wholly made voide, and to haue no effect at all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>third Suppoſition</hi> is, that the very ſame ciuill power, and authoritie to enact lawes, doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in this kingdome, which it had, before this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to enact lawes with the counſell and conſent of the Parliament did firſt begin. Neither can any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion depriue a kingdome, or Common-wealth of that ſupreme Ciuill authoritie, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not from Religion, but from the law of nations, and nature. So that if any Chriſtian kingdome ſhould reuolt from the faith of Chriſt, fall into hereſie, or alſo Ethniciſme, yet ſhe ſhould haue no leſſe full, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authoritie to gouerne it ſelfe ciuilly, and to enact ciuill lawes, then if it neuer had receiued the faith, and religion of Chriſt. The reaſon is, becauſe as a temporall Common-wealth doth by the faith of Chriſt obtaine no temporall dominion, kingdome, or iuriſdiction, but only a right to attaine by due meanes to the kingdome of heauen; ſo by the want of faith it only loſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall right, and not that temporall iuriſdiction, which by the law of nations and nature is granted to all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Common-wealths, what Religion ſoeuer they doe profeſſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:489:108"/>8. The <hi>fourth Suppoſition</hi> is, that in this kingdome two <hi>Houſes,</hi> as wee call them, of <hi>Parliament</hi> are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, wherein all thoſe, who haue <hi>ſuffrages,</hi> doe vſe to ſit. The one is called the <hi>Lower houſe,</hi> which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thoſe perſons, who are elected by the people, or Commons: the other is called the <hi>Higher houſe,</hi> which comprehendeth the Peeres and Barons of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whether they bee <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Barons,</hi> or by what titles ſoeuer they be called; Neuertheleſſe all, and euery one of the aforeſaid Nobles haue their voyce in the <hi>Parliament</hi> by this onely title, that by the <hi>Kings</hi> priuilege they are made <hi>Barons</hi> of the kingdome, and not in regard that they are <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Dukes, Marqueſſes, or Earles.</hi> From whence it commeth to paſſe, that in this <hi>Higher houſe,</hi> which is onely one compoſed of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> of the kingdome, and not two <hi>houſes</hi> compoſed of the Lords ſpirituall and temporall, to the enacting of a law the ſuffrages of the <hi>Barons</hi> are indifferently num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, without regard how many voyces there be of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and how many of temporall Lords. Wherefore it may fall out, and ſometimes alſo it hath ſo happened, that a law may bee eſtabliſhed by the authoritie of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and by the whole kingdome be accounted a firme and forcible law, although euery one of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and Lords ſpirituall doe repugne, ſo that the greater part of the <hi>Barons,</hi> whether they be Lords ſpirituall or temporall doe giue their conſent.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. From hence may eaſily bee gathered a perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwere to the aforeſaid obiection. For whether we grant, that this cuſtome, priuilege, or couenant not to enact any lawes without the counſell and conſent of the aforeſaid three States of the Realme did firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the <hi>King</hi> alone, or from the Common-wealth, or from them both, yet it cannot be denied, but that by the mutual conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> and Common-wealth, it may either in part be altered, or wholly reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:489:109"/>
We grant therefore that no ciuill law, according to the preſent cuſtome of this kingdome, hath force to binde, vnleſſe by the authoritie of a true, and lawfull <hi>Parliament,</hi> (which doth conſiſt of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and of the <hi>Commons</hi>) it bee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Neuertheleſſe wee alſo affirme, that as it is in the power of the <hi>King,</hi> and Common-wealth, which the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth repreſent, to ordaine, that ciuill lawes bee enacted either by the <hi>Kings</hi> ſole authoritie, without the conſent or ſuffrages of the <hi>Prelates, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> or with their conſent, ſo alſo it is in the power of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> to declare, what perſons are to be vnderſtood by the names of <hi>Prelates, Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> whoſe voyces muſt bee required to enact lawes in the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And therefore as in times paſt Catholike <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and alſo <hi>Abbots</hi> were by the <hi>Kings</hi> priuilege made <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> of the kingdome, and gaue their voyces with other <hi>Barons</hi> in the vpper houſe of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Kings Maieſtie</hi> might in like manner giue the ſame dignitie, and authoritie to <hi>Deanes, Archdeacons,</hi> or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> Subiects.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Seeing therefore that the Proteſtant <hi>Biſhops</hi> of this kingdome are by the authoritie of the <hi>King</hi> and Common-wealth made <hi>Lords</hi> ſpirituall, or <hi>Barons</hi> of the kingdome, and by the whole kingdom are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuch, there can be made no doubt at all, but that they haue full authority with other <hi>Barons</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to preſcribe to the whole kingdome ciuill lawes being confirmed by the <hi>King:</hi> eſpecially ſeeing that they haue not ſuffrages in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they are true <hi>Biſhops</hi> in very deede, but as being by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> eſteemed for ſuch, they are by the <hi>Kings</hi> priuilege made <hi>Barons,</hi> and haue their place, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the <hi>Parliament</hi> with the other <hi>Barons</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And that the Proteſtant <hi>Biſhops</hi> are by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>King</hi> and Common-wealth made <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:489:109"/>
of the kingdome, it is manifeſt by an Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> holden the firſt yeere of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (which cannot be denied to bee a true <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſeeing that the Catholike <hi>Biſhops</hi> were preſent<note n="o" place="margin">As D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt Maſter Iuels Apologie part. 6. chap. 2.</note> thereat, and gaue their voyces with the other <hi>Barons</hi> of the kingdome) wherein it was decreed, <hi>that whoſoeuer hereafter ſhall by the Queenes Royall authoritie be preferred to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of an Archbiſhop, and Biſhop, and bee conſecrated according to the rites and ceremonies preſcribed by the Act of Parliament in the fifth yeere of King Edward the ſixth, ſhall haue authoritre to doe, and execute all thoſe things, concerning the name, title, degree, &amp; dignity of an Archbiſhop, and Biſhop, which any Archbiſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of this Realme did heretofore doe, and execute.</hi> And although one onely <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as D. <hi>Harding</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">In the place before cited.</note> relateth, gaue his aſſent thereunto, yet this, as may appeare by that, which wee ſaid a little before<note n="q" place="margin">Nu. 8.</note>, nothing letteth, but that the voyces of the other <hi>Barons</hi> being more in number, might, for the granting by the Kings ſpeciall gift, a temporall priuilege, as is a temporall dignitie, ouerſway, and preuaile. And by this it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of theſe times are true, and proper <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and conſequently that the ciuill lawes enacted by them, and confirmed by the <hi>Kings</hi> Royall aſſent, are eſtabliſhed by good, full, and lawfull authoritie. And this now with farre greater reaſon may be auerred, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at this day there are no Catholike <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who can challenge any place, or ſuffrage in the <hi>Parliament</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And this may ſuffice for the ſatisfying of all the arguments, which are vſually alleaged againſt the ſixth branch of this <hi>oath.</hi> For againſt thoſe laſt words <hi>[and I do renounce al pardons, and diſpenſations to the contrary]</hi> ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power to diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe with me in this <hi>oath,</hi> or any part thereof, of which wee haue before abundantly diſputed, I cannot deuiſe any thing of moment, which can bee obiected. For that, which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:489:110"/>
ſome vnlearned perſons, hearing this name of <hi>pardons,</hi> doe very vnlearnedly imagine, that in this clauſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to grant <hi>Pardons,</hi> or <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> is plainly friuolous, and very ridiculous: For that by the name of <hi>pardons,</hi> no other thing is ſignified in this clauſe of the <hi>oath,</hi> then that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power to diſpenſe with me in this <hi>oath,</hi> or any part thereof, or to abſolue me from the ſame, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to grant me any <hi>licenſe, pardon,</hi> or <hi>dispenſation,</hi> by vertue whereof I am not bound, to beare faith, and true obedience to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> to defend him to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of my power againſt all treaſons, and traiterous conſpiracies, and not to diſcloſe them, when they ſhall come to my knowledge, which <hi>pardons, licenſes,</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi> that euery Subiect may lawfully renounce, ſuppoſing that which hath been ſaid before, is too too manifeſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Second</hi> obiection is vſually made againſt thoſe words <hi>[according to theſe expreſſe words by me ſpoken, and according to the plaine, and common ſenſe of the ſame words, without any equiuocation, &amp;c.]</hi> For it ſeemeth, <hi>that whoſoeuer ſweareth theſe words muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be forſworne; conſidering that in this Oath are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many equiuocall words, and many common ſenſes of the ſame words: as for example,</hi> to depoſe the King, <hi>doth ſignifie,</hi> to depriue him of his Regall authority, <hi>and alſo,</hi> to thruſt him out of poſſeſſion of his Kingdome; to abſolue from this oath, <hi>doth ſignifie;</hi> to abſolue either from the thing ſworn, <hi>or onely,</hi> from the thing as ſworn: A Succeſſour <hi>doth ſignifie, both</hi> a lawfull, <hi>and alſo</hi> an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Succeſſour: As hereticall, <hi>may be taken either for</hi> hereticall indeed, <hi>or for</hi> hereticall onely in ſimilitude: <hi>and ſo of the like: Therefore he that taketh the oath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe expreſſe words, and ſweareth the aforeſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall ſpeeches, must of neceſſity vſe ſome equiuocation, and conſequently be forſworne, ſeeing that hee ſweareth to vſe no equiuocation at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this obiection it is <hi>anſwered firſt,</hi> that although in this <hi>Oath</hi> there be contained many equiuocal words, and many common ſenſes of the ſame words, if they be taken barely, and by themſelues alone; yet as in this <hi>Oath</hi> they are ioyned with other words, and with them doe compound a full and perfect ſentence, they are not ſo equiuocall, that all circumſtances duely conſidered according to the rules before<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 1. ſect. 2. et ſeq.</note> aſſigned for the interpreting of the words of Lawes, they haue according to the common vnderſtanding of men
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:489:112"/>
two ſenſes equally proper, which properly is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither is it vnuſual, that a word, taken by it ſelfe, be equiuocall, which being placed in a ſentence or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not, all circumſtances conſidered, equiuocal. As this word <hi>[Dog]</hi> being taken nakedly by it ſelfe, hath many ſignifications, yet if one talking with an other, in the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Dog</hi> daies, of the intemperate ſeaſon of the ayre, ſhould ſay, I greatly feare the <hi>Dog,</hi> this worde by the circumſtance of the time, &amp; other precedent words would be ſufficiently determined to ſignifie the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſtellation, and not an earthly <hi>Dog.</hi> And although there were in this <hi>oath</hi> many common ſenſes of the ſame ſentence, or propoſition, which neuertheleſſe is not true, as by anſwering all the particular obiections we haue ſhewed before, yet we might lawfully accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules before aſſigned, if there bee no other let, chuſe that common ſenſe, which is more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vs, ſo that it containe no abſurdity, nor is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the mind, and will of the Law-maker.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly it is anſwered,</hi> that theſe later words <hi>[with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any equiuocation &amp;c.]</hi> doe onely declare thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>[And all theſe things I doe plainely and ſincerely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and ſweare according to theſe expreſſe words by me ſpoken, and according to the common ſenſe, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſame words]</hi> ſo that they only ſignifie, that I doe deale plainly, and ſincerely without any fraud or guile, and that I doe not take the words in an other meaning, then the common ſenſe, and vnderſtading of the ſame words doe beare. And therefore although there bee ſome equiuocal words in this oath, if they bee taken by themſelues without conſidering all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as hath beene ſaid in the obiection, yet it doth not therefore follow, that when I ſpeake thoſe words, I doe equiuocate, or vſe equiuocation. For firſt it is one thing to vſe equiuocall words, which may bee called a materiall equiuocation, and an other thing to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:489:112"/>
equiuocate, or to vſe formall equiuocation. For to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate properly, or to vſe formall equiuocation, as it is commonly vnderſtood in this Kingdome, is to vſe equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall words, or ſome ſecret reſeruation, of purpoſe to delude the hearer, ſo that hee who heareth the words, vnderſtandeth them in another ſenſe, then he who vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth them, and it doth import an vnſincere manner of dealing. And therefore if any man aske vs, tell mee truely doe you equiuocate, or no, all men by this doe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſo vnderſtand, tell me truely, whether you deale with me ſincerely, and doe not take your words in an other ſenſe, then in common ſpeech they are vſually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? And therefore it may be, that the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> did cheefly for this end adde thoſe words <hi>[with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any equiuocation, &amp;c.]</hi> that if perchance in this oath there were many common ſenſes of the ſame ſentence, or propoſition, we ſhould take it in that common ſenſe wherein we thought the Law-maker to vnderſtand it: for this is the principall meaning, and intention of the Law-maker, that wee ſhould deale with him plainely, and ſincerely<note n="d" place="margin">And ſo his Maieſty vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth theſe words in his Apologie page. 51. nu. 14.</note> without any fraud, guile, or ſecret reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Moreouer,</hi> although wee ſhould admit, that in this oath there were not onely many equiuocall words, but alſo many equiuocall ſentences, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therefore, that in taking this oath wee muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity vſe ſome equiuocation; but rather it might from hence be inferred, that, if perchance in his oath there be contained many equiuocall ſentences according to the common vnderſtanding of the words, by vertue of this clauſe wee are bound, to declare publickely before wee take the whole oath, in what common ſenſe wee take that propoſition, which wee apprehend to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall, ſo that our ſenſe bee not repugnant to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Law-maker, and this is the moſt that the aforeſaid obiection can proue; wherefore if any one be perſwaded that thoſe words, <hi>to depoſe, Succeſſors, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,</hi>

or any ſuch like words bee equiuocall, hee may openly declare, in what ſenſe hee taketh thoſe words, and ſo hee ſhall eaſily auoid all equiuocation, and all danger of periurie, which otherwiſe by taking of this clauſe he may incurre.</p>

from him through feare, but this oath is taken by most men againſt their wills, and if it were in their free power, and election, they would not take it, but it is wrested from them for feare of looſing for euer all their temporall goods, lands, and liberty, therefore they cannot truly ſweare, that they doe take it heartily and willingly.</hi> This obiection is greatly vrged by Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Engliſh booke intituled, <hi>The Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a Catholike Engliſhman liuing in baniſhment for his religion, concerning a late book ſet forth and intituled; Triplici nodo: &amp;c. or, An Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> in which booke hee much labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 13. nu. 21.</note> to proue, <hi>that in this Oath beſides ciuill obedience are couched, and craftily conioyned alſo certaine Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall points, and which appertaine indeed to Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with no ſmall preiudice to the ſame.</hi> And <hi>this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter</hi> he confidently affirmeth, <hi>may eaſily be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by foure ſeuerall and diſtinct wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The firſt way,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is taken from the plain expreſſe words, ſenſe, and drift of the oath it ſelfe, for that beſides ciuill obedience, and the acknowledgement of our Soueraign to be true, and rightfull Lord ouer all his Dominions, and other ſuch like clauſes, whereat no man maketh difficulty, the ſaid oath containeth further, that I muſt ſweare in like manner ſome points concerning the limitation of the Popes authority, to wit, what he cannot doe towards his Maieſty, or his Succeſſours in any caſe whatſoeuer, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards all Kings, for the like reaſon is alſo in others:</hi> that he would ſay, <hi>that the Pope hath not power to depoſe the King, and to abſolue his Subiects from their allegiance, &amp;c. Which queſtion being brought from the particular</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, <hi>to the generall</hi> Theſis, <hi>concerning all Kings, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a point of Doctrine, and Catholike beleefe concerning the ſufficiency of Paſtorall authority left by our Sauiour in his Church to S.</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp; his Succeſſours, for redreſſing of all inconueniences that may fall out, which I (being a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) cannot in my conſcience forſweare without peril of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. And this is one way of cleering the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:489:114"/>4. But truely this way is not cleare enough but very intricate, and incumbred with many difficulties. For this queſtion concerning the Popes power to depoſe Princes, and to abſolue ſubiects from their allegeance, doth not appertaine to Catholike doctrine, or beliefe, as heretofore<note n="c" place="margin">In my Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</note> wee haue aboundantly ſhewed, (where<note n="d" place="margin">Nu. 203. &amp; ſeq.</note> alſo wee haue more particularly anſwered thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> his Mitigation hath brought to this purpoſe) &amp; hereafter againſt D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> we will, God willing, more diſtinctly proue the ſame: but this power may with a ſafe conſcience be denied by Catholikes without danger of denying the Catholike faith. All Catholikes doe indeede acknowledge that the Pope is the Paſtour of the Catholike Church, and that he hath al ſufficient, and neceſſarie ſpirituall power to gouerne the flock of Chriſt, but whether this his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power is to be extended to the depoſing of <hi>Kings,</hi> and to the abſoluing of Subiects from their temporall allegeance, <hi>is a controuerſie,</hi> ſaith Trithemius,<note n="e" place="margin">In Chronico Monaſterii Hirſang ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num 1106.</note> 
                     <hi>amongſt the Schoole-men, and as yet it is not decided by the Iudge, whether the Pope hath power to depoſe the Emperour, or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The ſecond way,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to cleere this queſtion, is taken from the Popes words in his Breues, wherein he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that this oath containeth many things, which are clearely repugnant to the Catholike faith, and the health of ſoules.</hi> And this way is indeede, in ſome part, cleere: for it is cleere and manifeſt, that the Pope in his <hi>Breues</hi> did ſo declare, but neuertheleſſe it is as yet vnknowne, and hidden from vs, what in particular be thoſe many things, which are cleerely repugnant to Catholike faith, and the health of ſoules: which point, if Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> had declared, and cleered, as Engliſh Catholikes did expect he would haue done, he had then doubtleſſe ſomewhat cleerely explained this queſtion. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Popes Breues</hi> we will beneath<note n="f" place="margin">The next chap. ſect 2.</note> treate more at large.</p>
                  <p n="6">

                     <hi>may be taken from Cardinall Bellarmines letter, who hauing diligently conſidered with other learned men the nature of this oath, doth therefore hould it to be vnlawfull, for that it is ſo compounded by artificiall ioyning together of temporall, and ſpirituall things, ciuill obedience, and forſwearing the Popes authoritie.</hi> But this way is no whit cleerer, but rather more obſcure, than the former: for although Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth indeede auerre thus much, yet, as it is euident by that, which hath beene ſaid before, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it with ſuch weake, and ſilly reaſons, that thoſe, who are of opinion, that the oath is lawfull, and that nothing is therein contained, which is repugnant to Catholike faith, are rather thereby confirmed in their opinion, than any whit auerted from the ſame. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what concerning this point wee haue ſaid before in the 7. Chapter, Sect. 2. Num. 15.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The <hi>fourth way,</hi> which Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> hath deuiſed <hi>for a more full, and finall cleering of this matter,</hi> is the framing of an other oath, to wit, <hi>to make this reall offer on the behalfe of euery Engliſh Catholike for better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Maieſtie in this point, ſo much vrged of their Ciuill, and Temporall obedience, that he will ſweare, and acknowledge moſt willingly all thoſe parts, and clauſes of the</hi> Oath, <hi>that doe</hi> any way appertaine to the Ciuill, and Temporal <hi>obedience due to his Maiestie, whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for his true, and lawfull King, and Soueraigne ouer al his Dominions, and that he will ſweare vnto him as much loyaltie, as euer any Catholike Subiect of England did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their lawfull King in former times, and ages, before the change of</hi> King Henry <hi>the eighth: or, that any forraine Subiect oweth, or ought to ſweare to any Catholike</hi> Prince <hi>whatſoeuer at this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. But <hi>firſt</hi> this way doth no whit cleare this preſent queſtion, whether the oath be vnlawfull, and contrarie to Catholike beleefe, or no. For what, I pray you, do h it auaile, to proue that in this particular <hi>Oath</hi> is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:489:115"/>
or not contained any thing more then ciuill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for that all Catholikes will ſweare in generall words all thoſe things, which appertaine to Ciuill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? <hi>Secondly,</hi> all Catholikes will <hi>forſooth</hi> ſweare in generall words, that King <hi>Iames</hi> is their lawfull <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Soueraigne Lord,</hi> and they will promiſe vnto him in generall words Obedience, but in particular, for how long a time he ſhall bee their Lawfull <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord,</hi> and for what time they will promiſe vnto him Obedience, to wit, whether for euer, or onely for a certain time, vntil the <hi>Pope</hi> depoſe him, and diſcharge his Subiects of their Obedience, all Catholike Subiects will not perchance aduenture to ſweare.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Kings Maieſty</hi> auoucheth, that in this particular <hi>Oath</hi> is contained nothing beſides that ciuill Obedience, and temporall Allegiance, which euery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Subiect, if his Prince vpon iuſt cauſe ſhall demand it at his hands, may with a good conſcience, and alſo ought to ſweare. Yea in very deed he in this oath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of his Engliſh Subiects no other thing, then which the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> doth publickly profeſſe to bee due vnto their moſt <hi>Chriſtian King;</hi> to wit, <hi>that the Pope hath not power to depriue the King of France of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that notwithſtanding any monitions, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, or Interdicts, which may be made by the Pope, yet his Subiects are bound to yeeld obedience due to him for temporalls, neither that they can therein be diſpenſed, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by the Pope.</hi> Would Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> trow you, if he were now aliue, alſo affirme, that this aſſertion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Catholike Doctrine, and beliefe, for that <hi>it containeth ſome things concerning the limitation of the Popes authority,</hi> or would he auerre with Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> that this aſſertion is compounded of a ſpirituall thing to wit, <hi>of the deniall of the Popes authority?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Finally,</hi> the laſt argument, which Father <hi>Parſons</hi> doth as by the way bring to impugne this <hi>Oath</hi> of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, is that obiection, which we haue ſet downe in

                  <p n="25">25. To conclude therefore this anſwere, it is falſe, which Father <hi>Parſons</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Nu. 29. before cited.</note> affirmeth, <hi>that there is no other freedome in taking this, then which a Merchant hath in a tempeſt, either to caſt out his goods into the ſea, for lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſhip, or to be drowned himſelfe:</hi> For the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which cauſeth the Merchant to caſt out his goods into the ſea, is to eſcape that danger of drowning, which if it were not, he would be altogether vnwilling to caſt away his goods: but the onely motiue, why a loyall ſubiect, and well affected to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> ought to take this <hi>oath,</hi> is not the feare of puniſhments, but the loue and deſire hee hath to obey the iuſt and lawfull command of his Prince, whom he is readie to obey, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhould impoſe no puniſhment on them, who ſhould tranſgreſſe his law. The compariſon of Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> betwixt the taking of this <hi>oath,</hi> and the caſting of ones goods into the Sea, had been doubtleſſe apt, and fit enough, if the <hi>Oath</hi> were in it ſelfe vnlawfull, for then the only feare of puniſhment, and of incurring his <hi>Maieſties</hi> diſpleaſure, could moue the ſubiects to take the <hi>oath:</hi> but vnleſſe this firſt be proued, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

And therefore for the fully ſatisfying of timorous conſciences, I thought it neceſſarie to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this obiection ſomewhat at large, and out of the Doctrine of Catholike Diuines to ſet downe certaine generall rules, by the which, if they be well obſerued, any Catholike man as well vnlearned, as learned, may cleerely perceiue, how he may with a ſafe conſcience, and without danger of temeritie, or any other crime fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low both in ſpeculation and in practiſe, this, or that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whereof there is diſagreement among Catholike Diuines. And in ſetting downe theſe rules, I haue for this eſpeciall cauſe choſen to follow before others that moſt learned Diuine of the ſocietie of Ieſus <hi>Gabriel Vaſquez,</hi> for that the chiefe impugners of this <hi>Oath,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will not doubtleſſe condemne the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this famous Diuine concerning this point as improbable, both in regard of his ſingular learning, and alſo for that he is one of their owne ſocietie.</p>

it is neceſſary to chooſe one of thoſe two opinions, in both which there is ſinne.

                  <p n="40">40 This neuertheles is diligently to be obſerued, that although it be moſt probable, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may erre in his priuate Iudgments, lawes, decrees and precepts, and <hi>both through ignorance and malice,</hi> ſaith <hi>Canus</hi>

But ſuppoſing that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot erre in his definitions, lawes and decrees, which he preſcribeth not to the whole Church, but onely to priuate perſons, or Churches, if one moued with very great, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſons ſhould affirme, that he in defining, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, or forbidding this or that thing hath erred, and through ignorance, inconſideration, or euill infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was deceiued, he ought not therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of temerity, ſcandall, or any other crime.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be ſuppoſed out of the Doctrine of <hi>Suarez</hi> before<note n="o" place="margin">cap. 1. ſect: 4.</note> related, that euery decree of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Councell</hi> belonging to manners, is either a meere <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiue precept,</hi> to wit, which of it ſelfe maketh the act, which it forbiddeth, to be vnlawful for this only cauſe, for that it is forbidden by that precept, as is the eating of fleſh in Lent, and the doing of Seruile works vpon
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:489:140"/>
Sundaies, which if they were not forbidden by the Church-lawes, they would not be vnlawfull, or elſe it is a <hi>declaratiue precept,</hi> which doth not induce a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, but onely confirmeth a former, neither doth it make, but ſuppoſe the act wich it forbiddeth to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vnlawful; as being forbid before by ſome other former Law. <hi>A conſtitutiue precept</hi> of humane power although it may ſometimes bind with danger of ſome great temporall loſſe, as of goods, liberty, yea and now and then alſo of life; yet the Eccleſiaſticall Law ſetting aſide ſcandall, and contempt, which are forbidden by the Law of God, and nature, doth ſeldome, or neuer bind with very great temporall harme. And therefore we are not bound to abſtaine from fleſh in Lent, or not to doe ſeruile works vpon the Sunday, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs by the Church— Lawes, when wee are like to incurre any probable danger of ſome great temporal hurt thereby.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. <hi>A declaratiue precept,</hi> as wel noteth <hi>Suarez</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">In the place before cited.</note>, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth onely vpon the reaſon, for which the act is commanded, or forbidden, and vpon the obligation of the former precept: in ſomuch that if the reaſon for which the precept is impoſed, be not true, and no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Law, or obligation, as in the <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept is affirmed to bee, can bee found, the <hi>declaratiue</hi> precept hath no force to bind at all. As for example, his <hi>Holines</hi> forbiddeth al Engliſh Catholikes to take this <hi>Oath, for that it containeth many things, which are cleerely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Faith and Saluation;</hi> If therefore in this oath no thing can be found, which is repugnant to faith, or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, this <hi>declaratiue</hi> prohibition of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> which is founded in this reaſon, is according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Suarez</hi> of no force, neither doth it bind Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Catholikes to obſerue the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="43">43 Neuertheleſſe it is to be obſerued, that the <hi>Popes</hi> reaſon, or declaration may be either <hi>definitiue,</hi> whereby he intendeth to bind all Engliſh Catholikes to beleeue
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:489:140"/>
certainly as a point of faith, that his reaſon, or declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, and then we are bound to beleeue with the ſame certainty that his reaſon, and declaration is true, wherewith we are bound to beleeue that he hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er infallibly to define: or elſe it is onely <hi>opinatiue,</hi> to wit, grounded in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for which he probably thinketh that the reaſon which he alleadgeth is true, and that in very deed there is ſuch a former precept as he ſuppoſeth; and then his <hi>declaratiue precept,</hi> doth bind no more then his reaſon, &amp; <hi>opinion</hi> can bind, &amp; conſequently we are more no bound to obey his <hi>declaratiue precept,</hi> then wee are bound to follow his <hi>opinion,</hi> whereon his <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue precept</hi> doth onely depend.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Firſt therefore it is certaine, that this decree of the <hi>Pope,</hi> wherein he forbiddeth Engliſh Catholikes to take this <hi>Oath</hi> is a meere declaratiue precept, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the words of the firſt <hi>Breue,</hi> to which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two haue relation. For after that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had in his <hi>Breue related</hi> the whole <hi>Oath</hi> word by word, hee writeth thus: <hi>Which being ſo it ought to be manifest vnto you by the words themſelues, that this Oath cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without hurt to the Catholike faith, and to the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ſoules, ſeeing that it containeth manie things which are clearely repugnant to Faith, and ſaluation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we admoniſh you, that you altogether abſtaine from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this, and the like oaths, which truely wee doe the more earneſtly dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of you, for that we hauing had triall of your constant faith.</hi> &amp;c. So that it is euident that the onely cauſe for which his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> forbiddeth the taking of this <hi>Oath,</hi> is for that he thinketh it to bee otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and to containe in it many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith, and ſaluation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that this is not a <hi>constitutiue,</hi> but a meere <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue</hi> prohibition.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is alſo certaine, that it is ſuch a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue</hi> precept, which is founded not in any infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible definition of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whereby hee decreeth, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:489:141"/>
the reaſon which he alleadgeth is moſt certaine, and to bee beleeued as a point of faith, as hath beene ſhewed before,<note n="q" place="margin">Nu, 32. &amp; ſect</note> but it is onely grounded vpon his <hi>opinatiue</hi> iudgement, whereby he probably perſwadeth himſelfe, that his reaſon is true, and that the <hi>oath</hi> doth containe in it many things, which are flat contrary to faith and ſaluation. Which being ſo, it is moſt manifeſt, that wee are no farther bound to obſerue this command of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> then wee are bound to follow his opinion, whereon his Declaratiue precept doth onely depend. Wherefore, if this <hi>oath</hi> be not of it ſelfe vnlawfull, nor doth conteine any thing which is repugnant to faith or ſaluation, eſpecially in that ſenſe, wherein the Engliſh Catholikes doe take it, and wherein the words of the <hi>oath,</hi> according to their proper and vſuall ſignification are commonly vnderſtood, but onely temporall alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which euery temporall <hi>Prince</hi> may, if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, lawfully demand of his ſubiects, as by examining euery clauſe of the <hi>oath</hi> I haue, as I thinke, ſufficiently proued, truly there can be made no doubt, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Engliſh Catholike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding the <hi>Popes</hi> prohibition, may with a ſafe conſcience, and without any preiudice to the Catholike faith take the ſame. And this may ſuffice concerning the particular precept or command of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="46">46. Now concerning that third thing, to wit, the <hi>Popes</hi> iudgement, opinion and aduiſe, which beſides his definition and command may, as we haue ſaid, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in a <hi>Breue,</hi> it is moſt certaine, that no man is bound to follow his opinions, admonitions, counſels or exhortations. Euery man may, if he will, follow his admonition and aduiſe, ſo that he counſaile him no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, or vnlawfull thing, but that wee are bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his counſell in lawfull things, is againſt all reaſon, as euidently appeareth by the Euangelicall counſels, which are much ſuperiour to the <hi>Popes</hi> counſels. The <hi>Popes</hi> iudgement, and opinion when it is contrary to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:489:141"/>
the opinion of other learned Catholikes, any man may lawfully reiect; and eſpecially if to follow his opinion, ſhould bee very preiudiciall to himſelfe, or others; and alſo if it be grounded vpon ſleight reaſons and falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, as partly wee haue ſhewed before how weake thoſe arguments bee, which are commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt this <hi>Oath,</hi> and partly we wil beneath<note n="r" place="margin">Nu. 51. &amp; ſect.</note> by Father <hi>Parſons</hi> letters make it manifeſt, that his <hi>Holines</hi> was not rightly informed concerning the true meaning of this <hi>Oath.</hi> And truly to diſlike whatſoeuer the Popes <hi>Holineſſe</hi> diſliketh, and to approue whatſoeuer hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth, and to grant him without due examination all that authoritie, which ſome <hi>Popes</hi> haue claimed or may claime, doth ſeeme to fauour rather of ouer much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, then of moderate diſcretion, whereof the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many <hi>Popes</hi> doe yeeld ſufficient teſtimonie; in ſo much that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Controuerſies, hath much adoe to excuſe many <hi>Popes,</hi> not onely from beleeuing, but alſo from teaching publickly flat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; and neuertheleſſe he doth freely acknowledge that ſome <hi>Popes</hi> did publickly teach &amp; maintaine, although not manifeſt hereſie, yet falſe doctrine.</p>

                  <p n="61">61 Concerning this third <hi>Breue</hi> fiue things are to be obſerued. The firſt is, that this <hi>Breue</hi> containeth partly a <hi>conſtitutiue,</hi> and partly a <hi>declaratiue precept,</hi> or rather a declaration of a former precept. The <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept,</hi> or rather the declaration of a former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept doth conſiſt in this, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept doth not make, but ſuppoſe, and declare the <hi>oath</hi> to be of it ſelfe vnlawfull. And although this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſhould vertually containe in it a precept, it is for that it ſuppoſeth, and preſumeth that many things are contained in <hi>this Oath,</hi> which are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to faith and ſaluation. Which declaration, or vertuall prohibition being onely grounded on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and on his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> opinion hath no more force to binde Catholikes to belieue that this <hi>Oath</hi> is of it ſelfe vnlawfull, and that it containeth many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith &amp; ſaluation, then bindeth his opinion, when it is againſt the probable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of other Catholikes, who can not perceiue, that in this <hi>Oath</hi> is contained any thing, which ſo much as obſcurely is againſt faith or ſaluation; eſpecially in that ſenſe, wherein they take the <hi>Oath,</hi> and thinke it to bee
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:489:146"/>
lawfull, and which ſenſe they perſwade themſelues to be agreeable to the proper and vſuall ſignification of the words, and to the meaning of the Lawmaker. And therefore as we are not bound, according to that which hath been ſaid before, to follow the opinion of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> when other learned Catholikes do diſagree from him, ſo neither are wee bound to obey his <hi>Declaratiue precept,</hi> and much leſſe a <hi>bare declaration</hi> thereof, when it dependeth only vpon his opinion.</p>
                  <p n="62">62 The <hi>conſtitutiue precept</hi> of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> doth conſiſt in this, that he commandeth Maſter <hi>Archprieſt,</hi> that he obſeruing certaine conditions, do depriue, and declare depriued of all faculties thoſe Prieſts, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or haue taught, and do teach that it may lawfully be taken. And this <hi>precept</hi> being a meere penall conſtitution in reſpect of the Prieſts who haue taken the <hi>Oath</hi> or haue taught, and doe teach that it may lawfully be taken, doth not of it ſelfe forbid the taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> but ſuppoſeth that it is before other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forbidden. And therefore no ſtronger, but rather a far weaker argument can be drawne from this <hi>Breue,</hi> then from the former to proue, that this <hi>Oath</hi> is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and containeth in it many things, which are cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to faith, and ſaluation. But in reſpect of Maſter <hi>Archprieſt</hi> it is not a meere penall conſtitution, but a true, and proper <hi>conſtitutiue precept,</hi> and binding him (as it is manifeſt by thoſe words, <hi>and we enioine, and command thee</hi>) to obſerue all that which in this <hi>Breue</hi> is commanded him; ſo that he may as eaſily tranſgreſſe his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> command by exceeding his commiſſion, to wit, if he depriue of faculties thoſe Prieſts, whom he hath no authoritie to depriue, as by neglecting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them, whom by his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> command hee is bound to depriue.</p>
                  <p n="63">63 <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be obſerued, that although ſome of the vnlearneder ſort may perchance from this <hi>Breue</hi> take ſome occaſion to imagine, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> did by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:489:147"/>
a firme decree <hi>define,</hi> that this <hi>Oath</hi> containeth in it many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith and ſaluation, for that, if according to the rules before<note n="l" place="margin">Nu. 34.</note> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> &amp; Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Popes <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had excommunicated all thoſe, who ſhould teach that the <hi>Oath</hi> may lawfully be taken, it had bene doubtleſſe a manifeſt ſigne,<note n="m" place="margin">See there in the marginall note how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a ſigne it had beene.</note> that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> intended to make a firm decree, and definition of faith, why then may we not now rightly inferre, that in this <hi>Breue</hi> hee hath defined the ſame, ſeeing that he inflicteth ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous an Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, and which is moſt neere to excommunication, to wit, Suſpenſion from iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or depriuing of all faculties, vpon all thoſe Engliſh Prieſts, who doe teach that the <hi>Oath</hi> may lawfully bee taken.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. But this obiection is altogether friuolous. For firſt, there is a great diſparity betwixt <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> or taking away of faculties, for being a ſigne to know when any thing is by the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Councells</hi> firmely decreed to bee a point of faith. For when the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Councells</hi> doe define any thing to bee of Faith, they intend to account all thoſe, who preſume to beleeue the contrary, for heretikes, and to exclude them from the company of the faithful and right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which ſeparation from the Society of the faithfull is very well expreſſed by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> but not by <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> for that one may be depriued of all faculties, and ſuſpended from all Iurisdiction, and neuertheleſſe be partaker with the reſt of the faithfull in all thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine rites, ceremonies, and ſpirituall graces, which are common to all Chriſtians, and right beleeuers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Diuine, that I haue read, did euer affirme, that depriuing of faculties, or Suſpenſion are ſufficient ſignes to diſcerne when the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Councel</hi> defineth any thing to be of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. <hi>Beſides</hi> although the <hi>Pope</hi> had not onely taken away their faculties, but alſo had exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated thoſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:489:147"/>
Engliſh Prieſts, who taught that the <hi>Oath</hi> may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee taken, yet from thence it could not bee rightly concluded, that he had by a firme, and infallible defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith condemned the <hi>Oath,</hi> ſeeing that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> before<note n="n" place="margin">Nu. 32.</note> related, to make the <hi>Popes</hi> definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee infallible, and to bee beleeued as a point of Faith, it is neceſſary that they bee propounded to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church, and not to priuate Biſhops, or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; <hi>for they are to be vnderſtood</hi> ſaith <hi>Canus,</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Nu. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>onely in this caſe to pronounce of faith, when the ſentence belongeth to all Chriſtians, when it bindeth all.</hi> But this <hi>Breue</hi> is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to one onely <hi>Arch-Prieſt</hi> with an expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not to excommunicate, or otherwiſe to puniſh all the Catholikes euen of one kingdome, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue onely thoſe Prieſts, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or haue taught, and doe teach that it may lawfully be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of all thoſe faculties, and priuiledges, which they haue receiued from the See-Apoſtolike. And therefore to gather from this third <hi>Breue</hi> that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> hath defined the <hi>Oath</hi> to bee vnlawfull it is vaine, friuolous, and altogether ridiculous. Wherefore his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> did not intend to bind Engliſh Catholikes more by this <hi>Breue,</hi> but rather leſſe then by the former not to take the <hi>Oath:</hi> for that in his former <hi>Breues</hi> he doth by a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue precept</hi> expreſly forbid Catholikes to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> but in this <hi>Breue</hi> no expreſſe prohibition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but rather ſuppoſed, and a puniſhment inflicted not vpon all Engliſh Catholikes, but vpon thoſe Prieſts only, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or haue taught, and do teach that it may lawfully bee taken: therefore a farre weaker argument to prooue this <hi>Oath</hi> to bee vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full can bee drawne from this <hi>Breue,</hi> then from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p n="66">66 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is to be obſerued, that it is not all one to depriue a Prieſt of his Faculties, and to forbid him to ſay Maſſe, and others to be preſent with him at Diuine
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:489:148"/>
Seruice, as ſome of the vulgar ſort through ignorance doe imagine, who thinke that if a Prieſt be depriued of his faculties, he is forthwith ſuſpended from the Altar. For as there be many Prieſts beyond the Seas, who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay Maſſe, and others are preſent thereat, and yet they haue no faculties at al, nor authority to hear confeſſions, ſo alſo the taking away of their faculties doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre them from ſaying Maſſe, nor others to be preſent at it. But conſidering that no Prieſt by vertue of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination hath full authority to miniſter the Sacrament of Penance, or to exerciſe any other act of ſpirituall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as to excommunicate, to diſpenſe in vowes, or oaths, and ſuch like, although he hath full authority to ſay Maſſe, no Iuriſdiction being required therunto, as the giuing of faculties doth conſiſt in this, that ful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, licenſe, and faculty is giuen to a Prieſt to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lawfully, and with effect the Sacrament of Penance, or to exerciſe any other ſpirituall Iuriſdiction, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath more or fewer, greater or leſſer faculties granted him, ſo the taking away his faculties doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this, that hee is depriued of that ſpirituall Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which by the priuiledge of the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> he hath receiued; ſo that the depriuing a Prieſt of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is a certaine partiall <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> as the Diuines doe ſpeake, not from <hi>Order,</hi> and from exerciſing thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which belong to <hi>Order,</hi> but from <hi>Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and from exerciſing thoſe functions which depend thereon.</p>
                  <p n="67">67 <hi>Fourthly</hi> it is to bee obſerued, that the Church doth not vſually, and perchance cannot ſuſpend, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate any man with <hi>Maior ſuſpenſion,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication but for ſome <hi>mortall</hi> ſin; for that theſe kind of <hi>cenſures</hi> are puniſhments, and medicines, which alwaies ſuppoſe ſome precedent ſinne, and ſpiritual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie. And therfore <hi>it is a generall, and certaine principle,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">De Cenſuris diſp. 4. ſec. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that the fault for which the</hi> cenſure, <hi>is to be impoſed, ought to bee proportionable to the</hi> cenſure, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:489:148"/>
according to Naturall reaſon, the puniſhment ought to haue equall proportion to the fault, and contrariwiſe. For it is against</hi> commutatiue <hi>iustice to inflict a great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a ſmall fault. Wherefore it is certain, that a great</hi> cenſure, <hi>that is, which depriueth of goods of great moment and of it ſelfe cauſeth great harme: and therefore may aptly be called a greater, or</hi> Maior cenſure, <hi>doth at the leaſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a</hi> mortall <hi>ſinne, that it may iuſtly be inflicted.</hi> Seeing therefore that the iudgements and opinions of <hi>Popes,</hi> as well ſaid <hi>Pope Innocentius</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Aboue cited nu. 39.</note>, are not alwaies grounded vpon truth, and therefore they may ſometimes iudge that to be a ſinne, which is no ſinne indeede, and one to haue committed that crime, which in very deed he hath not committed, it may alſo ſomtimes fall out, that one is <hi>excommunicated</hi> or <hi>ſuſpended</hi> in the outward face of the Church, who before God, whoſe iudgement is not grounded on preſumption, but vpon truth, is not in very deede either <hi>excommunicated,</hi> or ſuſpended.</p>
                  <p n="68">68 Seeing therefore that the depriuing one of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which is inflicted for a fault committed, and which truly, and properly is a <hi>puniſhment</hi> (for concerning an abſolute reuoking of a priuiledge, faculty, or Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on granted there is not the ſame reaſon) is a certaine <hi>Maior ſuſpenſion</hi> not from the vſe of his Order, but from the exerciſing of his Iuriſdiction, we may well ſuppoſe, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had no intention to puniſh with ſo great puniſhment, as is the taking away of faculties, thoſe Prieſts who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or haue taught, and doe teach that it may lawfully be taken, but for that he certainly perſwaded himſelfe that they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted periurie, ſo that if in very deede they haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſuch crime, we may iuſtly preſume, that his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi> did not intend to depriue them of their faculties, and conſequently that they are not in very deed depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them: although by reaſon of ſcandall they ought not (ſuppoſing that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Arch-Prieſt</hi> hath lawfully, and according to his commiſſion proceeded againſt them)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:489:149"/>
to vſe their faculties publickely, and before them to whom their innocencie is not yet ſufficiently knowne, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to contemne the keyes of the Church; yet doubtleſſe no man, who will confeſſe that this taking away of faculties is inflicted vppon thoſe Prieſts properly as a puniſhment for ſome fault by them committed, can make any doubt, but that in very deede their Sacramentall abſolutions, their diſpenſations, and ſuch like acts of Iuriſdiction are valide &amp; effectuall.</p>

And from hence <hi>thirdly</hi> it may alſo certainely be gathered, that, ſuppoſing in penall lawes the words are not to be extended, but to bee reſtrained, which is a moſt certaine rule, and approued by all Lawyers, if any Secular Prieſt hath neither taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> neither hath taught, nor doth teach that it may lawfully be taken,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:489:150"/>
although hee ſhould inwardly in his minde thinke it very probable, that the <hi>Oath</hi> may lawfully be taken, and for that cauſe hee ſhould outwardly carry himſelfe <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely,</hi> and neither poſitiuely defend it, nor poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely condemne it, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archprieſt</hi> by vertue of this <hi>Breue</hi> hath no authority granted him to depriue this Prieſt of his faculties. The reaſon is euident, for that to <hi>teach</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> to be lawfull is <hi>poſitiuely</hi> to defend it, and <hi>outwardly</hi> to approue it, but this Prieſt doth outwardly neither defend it, nor condemne it, but outwardly hee carrieth himſelfe <hi>negatiuely,</hi> and therefore hee doth not <hi>teach</hi> that it may lawfully, or may not lawfully bee taken.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. From whence alſo it followeth, that although ſuch a Prieſt hauing diligently examined all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are brought againſt the lawfull taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and cleerely in his owne iudgement percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the weakeneſſe of them dare not condemne of mortall ſin thoſe Catholikes, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or doe teach that it may lawfully bee taken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Sacrament of Penance he abſolueth them from all their other ſinnes which they haue confeſſed, and whereof they are contrite, not examining them whether they haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or taught it to bee lawfull (if he ſuppoſe they haue no ſcruple thereof) but leauing them in this point to their owne conſciences, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archprieſt</hi> by vertue of this <hi>Breue</hi> hath not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie granted him to depriue this Prieſt of his Faculties. For in propertie of ſpeech beyond which words in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lawes are not to be extended it can not rightly be ſaid, that this Prieſt doth <hi>teach</hi> that the <hi>Oath</hi> may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be taken, conſidering that in this point he carrieth himſelfe meere negatiuely, and doth not exerciſe any poſitiue act of teaching, or maintaining. Wherefore betwixt preachers, <hi>teachers</hi> and beleeuers of hereſie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this their inward opinion or beleefe bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly made manifeſt, there is a great diſtinction, as is

                  <p n="76">76. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> to conclude; it ſeemeth to me alſo to be certaine, that thoſe Secular Prieſts, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> or haue taught, and doe teach that it may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be taken, are not by the ſentence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archprieſt</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſidering that in penall lawes, as hath been ſaid before<note n="x" place="margin">Cap. 1. ſect. 3.</note>, words are not to bee extended, but rather to be reſtrained, neither <hi>can a delegate Iudge,</hi> as well ſaid <hi>Suarez</hi>

And this is a maine ground why certaine Prieſts, who although they are thought by many to be depriued of their faculties by the ſentence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt,</hi> yet they are not afraide to vſe them publikely, for that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Archprieſt,</hi> as they doe auouch<note n="z" place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Warmington</hi> in his moderate defence of the <hi>Oath</hi> of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. pag. 159. &amp; ſeq.</note>, did neuer in very deed depriue them of their faculties, but onely did publickly denounce or declare, that they <hi>wer to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi> or at the moſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they <hi>were depriued</hi> of their faculties.</p>

And thus much concerning the former part of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obiection, which was taken from the authoritie of his <hi>Holineſſe Breues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="78">78. To the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of the <hi>obiection,</hi> which is drawen from the teſtimony of the moſt learned writers of this age, it is very eaſily anſwered. For as before<note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 11.</note> we haue ſhewed out of the doctrine of <hi>Gabriell Vaſquez,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 11.</note> and others, the multitude of Diuines doth not make the opinion, which they follow to bee vndoubtedly true, and the contrary opinion of other Catholikes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be farre fewer in number, to be void of all probabilitie, vnleſſe the reaſons and grounds, which they bring to confirme their doctrine, be ſo ſtrong and conuincing, that they make the contrary opinion to be altogether improbable. Now that the reaſons and grounds, which theſe moſt learned Diuines haue brought to proue this <hi>Oath</hi> to be vnlawfull, and clearly repugnant to the Catholike faith, as his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> hath declared, and for which onely cauſe he hath forbid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes to take this <hi>Oath,</hi> are very weake, and in my
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:489:152"/>
opinion not beſeeming the learning of ſuch famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, is manifeſt enough, both by the Anſwers which we haue made vnto them, &amp; alſo by the Confeſſions of almoſt all our countrey men, euen of thoſe who doe fauour Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, who do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not without a litle bluſhng that his arguments are very weake and vnſound.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. Wherfore, euen from the authoritie of the moſt learned Diuines of theſe daies may alſo on the contrary be drawen a probable argument to proue, that this <hi>Oath</hi> is not vnlawfull, and that it doth not containe many things, which are clearely repugnant to faith. For if in this <hi>Oath</hi> many things are contained which are flat contrary to faith, as his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> in his <hi>Breues</hi> hath affirmed, and theſe moſt learned Diuines haue in their bookes endeauoured to confirme, without doubtſome one among ſo many moſt learned men would haue brought at the leaſt one thing among ſo many which are clearely repugnant to faith, but none of them hath as yet brought one onely propoſition contained in this <hi>Oath</hi> which is flat contrary to faith. Thereſore it is a moſt euident ſigne, that theſe Diuines did not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand the true ſenſe of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the world their vncertaine, not to ſay falſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for an vndoubted doctrine of faith, and that ſome of them did both wrongfully informe his <hi>Holines</hi> (who truſted to their learning and conſcience) of the true and plaine meaning of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and alſo did take vpon them to impugne the <hi>Oath,</hi> rather vpon affection, then moued with any ſound reaſon, perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues perchance at the firſt, as a certaine Ieſuite heere with vs hath freely affirmed, that no Catholike either was able, or ſurely durſt aduenture to gaine ſay, and write againſt men of ſuch ſingular learning, who were alſo armed with the ſupreame authority of the <hi>Popes Holineſſe.</hi> But <hi>great is the truth, and it doth</hi> (in the end) <hi>preuaile,</hi> it may for a time bee aſſaulted, but it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:489:153"/>
be ouercome.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. The Catholikes therefore of England, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> were moued from the beginning to take it, both for intrinſecall and extrinſecall grounds, that is, both for ſufficient reaſon, and alſo probable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Their <hi>reaſon</hi> was, for that they were aſſuredly perſwaded, that they were bound by the law of God to obey the iuſt command of their lawfull Prince, ſo long as they could not perceiue that hee commanded them any thing that was vnlawfull. But thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes could neuer perceiue, that in this <hi>Oath</hi> is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any hereticall, erroneous, or improbable poſition, and afterwards ſeriouſly conſidering how ſillily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiently men of ſuch excellent learning had impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, they were more ſtrongly confirmed in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The <hi>authoritie</hi> was, for that very many, if not the greater part of the learned Prieſts of this Realme, and alſo M. <hi>Archprieſt</hi> himſelfe did then either approue the taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> or durſt not condemne it as vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And although ſome of thoſe learned Prieſts, who at the beginning before any <hi>Breue</hi> was ſent hither for condemning the <hi>oath,</hi> did with all their might defend the lawfulneſſe thereof, yet afterwards, when they ſaw it was forbidden by his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> they ſeemed to draw back, neuertheleſſe that very many Prieſts, not onely who were priſoners, but alſo who were at libertie, did ſtill continue in their former opinion, which for feare of incurring his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> diſpleaſure they durſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly defend, is ſo manifeſt heere with vs, that if neede were, wee could proue it by many witneſſes, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a certaine very learned Prieſt did aptly ſay, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> by his <hi>Breues</hi> had tyed their tongues, but not ſatisfied their vnderſtanding) yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Breues</hi> very many both vertuous and learned Prieſts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now are not afraide either to defend publike<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="82">82 To make an end therefore now at the laſt of this <hi>Solution,</hi> and to <hi>anſweare in forme to the foreſaid obiection,</hi> it is anſweared <hi>firſt,</hi> that the <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition, to wit, <hi>In doubtfull, and diſputahle matters the ſurer part is to be choſen,</hi> is equiuocall. For if by <hi>a doubtfull matter</hi> be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that, to which our vnderſtanding giueth no aſſent, or diſſent at all, or which is all one, which wee
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:489:154"/>
neither iudge to be true, nor falſe, we grant the <hi>Maior,</hi> for in ſuch doubtfull matters the ſurer part is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as hath beene ſhewed before<note n="c" place="margin">Nu. 21.</note>. But if by a <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter</hi> be vnderſtood <hi>a diſputable matter,</hi> to wit, which is not certain, but is by Catholikes diſputed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably on both ſides, in which ſenſe the vulgar ſort do v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually take <hi>doubtfull,</hi> then we deny the <hi>Maior:</hi> For in ſuch <hi>doubtfull matters,</hi> whoſe truth, although it be not certaine, yet is probable, the ſurer part is not of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to he choſen, but, as we haue ſhewed, it is ſufficient to follow a ſecure, or probable opinion, to wit, which prudent, and learned men doe follow, although the greater part of Diuines, and alſo the <hi>Popes Holineſſe</hi> himſelfe doe defend the contrarie: neither doth he, that followeth ſuch a probable opinion againſt the more common, and the more probable opinion euen of the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, expoſe himſelfe to any danger of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, temeritie, or any other crime.</p>
                  <p n="83">83 <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> alſo is eaſily anſweared; for the authoritie of the learned Diuines of theſe daies, who thinke that the <hi>Oath</hi> is vnlawfull, and that it containeth in it many things flat contrarie to faith, and ſaluation, doth not make their opinion to be certaine, or <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> but only to be diſputable, &amp; at the moſt to be more probable, then the contrarie, if we regard only extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall and not intrinſecall grounds, that is, if we do not regard reaſon, but only authoritie. Neither hath his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> defined by his <hi>Breues,</hi> but only declaring his opinion hath affirmed, that the <hi>oath</hi> can not lawfully be taken, for that it containeth many things, which are cleerely repugnant to faith and ſaluation: for which cauſe he forbade Catholikes to take it. But it is manifeſt by that which hath beene ſaid before, that the <hi>Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue precept,</hi> which is grounded on his owne, or the probable opinion of others, is ſubiect to error, and that it hath no more force to bind, then hath the reaſon, or his opinion, whereupon only it doth depend. Neither
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:489:154"/>
are Catholikes bound to follow the <hi>Popes</hi> opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be farre the more probable, or to obey his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue command,</hi> which is founded in his opinion, when it is repugnant to the opinion of other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, although it be the leſſe probable: and then eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when to follow his opinion is very preiudiciall to himſelfe, or others as it happeneth in this <hi>Oath,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the refuſing, thereof, ſuppoſing that it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no vnlawfull thing, is very hurtfull to Catholikes, and greatly iniurious to his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="84">84 The other parts of the obiection, which ſeeme to proue, that there is greater danger of ſinning by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>oath,</hi> then by refuſing it, are of ſmall moment: for greater, or leſſe danger ſuppoſeth a danger, but, as before we haue proued, there is no danger at all of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curring periurie, or any other crime by taking the <hi>Oath,</hi> it being commanded by the authority of our lawfull King, and probably thought by vertuous and learned men to containe no vnlawfull aſſertion. And ſo this <hi>Statute</hi> for taking the <hi>Oath,</hi> is not a meere penall law binding only to puniſhment, and not to ſinne, but alſo a commanding precept, and which alſo bindeth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the Subiects to fulfill the lawfull command of their Prince, eſpecially in thoſe things, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably thought to appertaine to temporall allegiance, which is due to all lawfull Princes by the law of God, and nature. Neither doe Catholikes for that cauſe take the <hi>oath,</hi> or thinke it to be lawfull, becauſe Proteſtants doe command it, and thinke it to be lawfull, as though the Catholikes, who take the <hi>Oath,</hi> doe preferre the opinion of Proteſtants before the iudgement of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and of the ſupreme Paſtor ouer all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in things, which in ſome ſort do belong to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as is the Religious taking of an <hi>oath;</hi> But becauſe the <hi>Kings Maieſtie</hi> being our lawfull <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord</hi> in temporals what Religion ſoeuer he be of, hath commanded al his Subiects to take this <hi>Oath</hi> of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:489:155"/>
which vertuous, and learned Catholikes for probable reaſons are of opinion that it is truly an <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and that it containeth nothing, which is contrarie to Catholike faith, or Saluation, therefore Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes to obey the lawfull command of their Prince doe take this <hi>oath</hi> of Allegiance.</p>
                  <p n="85">85 And doubtleſſe, if the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould command the Subiects, to acknowledge by <hi>oath, that the Pope is not direct Lord of this kingdome in temporalls,</hi> and <hi>that he hath no direct power to depoſe our King,</hi> which (neuertheleſſe according to the doctrine of the Canoniſts doth belong to the <hi>Popes</hi> Primacie) and <hi>that notwithstanding any ſentence of depriuation denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or to be denounced by the Pope by vertue of this direct power againſt our King, they will beare faith and true alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to his Maieſtie &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>that the Pope by vertue of this direct power in temporals hath no authoritie to abſolue him from this oath or any part thereof, and ſo of the reſt,</hi> and his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> following the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> opinion (who doe with ſuch vehemency defend this his direct power in temporals ouer the whole Chriſtian world, that the contrarie opinion they thinke to be hereticall) ſhould forbid by his <hi>Breues</hi> this manner of <hi>oath,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it containeth (as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> doe imagine) many things flat contrarie to faith, and moreouer the learned Diuines of theſe daies ſhould for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons condemne the aforeſaid <hi>oath,</hi> The very ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in the very ſame words, to wit, <hi>in doubtfull and diſputable matters &amp;c.</hi> which we haue alleadged againſt the <hi>oath</hi> of Allegiance commanded by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> might alſo be brought againſt this <hi>oath,</hi> if the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould command it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And neuertheleſſe without doubt Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and thoſe other learned Diuines, who doe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turly reiect the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> opinion, would eaſily in the ſame manner, as we haue now anſwered to this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſatisfie alſo the other. Wherefore this preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:489:155"/>
taken from the authoritie of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and the other learned Diuines of theſe daies in a diſputable matter, which is probably diſputed by Catholikes on both ſides, can not euen in the iudgement of Card. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> be accounted a forcible, &amp; conuincing proofe.</p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning this <hi>ſecond obiection,</hi> in examing whereof I haue beene ſomewhat long, being deſirous to giue full ſatisfaction to timorous conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and alſo for that the vnlearneder ſort of perſons might eaſily diſcerne, how farre the <hi>Popes Breues,</hi> which are founded in his opinion, and alſo in the probable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of other Diuines, can binde Catholikes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them.</p>

                  <p n="7">7 Wherefore the aforeſaid words of S. <hi>Paul, Refraine your ſelues, ab omni ſpecie mala,</hi> are to be vnderſtood one of theſe two waies; <hi>firſt,</hi> that wee muſt refraine <hi>ab omni ſpecie mala,</hi> that is, <hi>from all kinde or ſort</hi> of euill, as the latine word <hi>[ſpecies]</hi> is taken by the Logicians, and in which ſenſe alſo it is ſometimes vſed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, as in the firſt Chapter of Geneſis<note n="i" place="margin">Verſ. 12.21.24 25.</note> 
                     <hi>And God made the beasts of the earth, iuxta ſpecies ſuas accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their kind.</hi> And the 28. of Eccleſiaſticus. <hi>Tres ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Three things, or three ſorts of men my ſoul hateth, a poore man that is proud, a rich man that is a lyar, a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ſenſleſſe olde man;</hi> fo that the meaning of the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be this, <hi>Omnia probate, Proue,</hi> or <hi>try all things,</hi> to wit, which are doubtfull, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> expoundeth, for things that are manifeſt, need no triall: <hi>quod bonum eſt tenete, hold, or keepe that which is good, Ab omni ſpecie mala, abſtinete vos, from all kinde of euill,</hi> both in words, deeds, and writings, as well in things that belong to doctrine, as to manners <hi>refraine your ſelues.</hi> And this expoſition ſeemeth agreeable to that, which ſome of the ancient Fathers doe write vpon this place, <hi>Probate,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Hierome, Try whether that which is ſaid bee againſt the Law, if there, be any ſuch thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from it.</hi> And <hi>Theophylactus, neque enim hoc, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> the meaning of thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is, that for the auoiding of ſcandall wee muſt refraine not onely from all kind of euill, or from euerie
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:489:157"/>
euill thing, but alſo from all ſhew, and appearance of euill, as S. <hi>Anſelme,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Gloſſe of <hi>Nicolas de Lyra,</hi> and other later writers doe commonly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and in our Engliſh Teſtament it is tranſlated. And then the aforeſaid counſell, or command of the Apoſtle is either ſo to be vnderſtood, that we muſt refraine from all ſhew of euill, when in refraining there alſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no ſhew of euill, and ſo by refraining no ſcandall can ariſe: for otherwiſe this text might bee alleadged both againſt the taking of the oath, and alſo the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof, for that not onely in taking it, but alſo in refuſing it there is, as we haue ſaid before, no little ſhew or appearance of euill: or elſe that we muſt refraine not onely from all euill, but alſo from all that wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth ſome ſhew of euill, <hi>vntill it be declared that it is</hi> in very deede <hi>lawfull,</hi> as the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> vpon that place doth interpret theſe words. But that this Oath may lawfully be taken hath now bene ſufficiently declared to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, both for that there bee now verie few lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, who if it be tendred them by the Magiſtrate, doe refuſe it, and where one refuſeth to take it, almoſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe take it, and doe thinke that with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they may lawfully take it: and eſpecially becauſe there can be alleadged no one particular clauſe of this <hi>Oath,</hi> which containeth any thing which is cleerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to faith, and ſaluation, as wee haue ſhewed by examining euery particular clauſe. As for Proteſtants, thoſe friuolous exceptions, which Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine, Gretzer,</hi> and others doe take againſt the <hi>Oath,</hi> do giue exceeding great ſcandall vnto them, who therefore are perſwaded, that the doctrine which Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> maintaineth to be <hi>Catholicke</hi> is a <hi>Seminary</hi> of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that according to it no euill Prince, or who is not a Catholicke, can be ſecure of the true, and conſtant allegiance of their Catholicke Subiects, which whether this giue iuſt occaſion of ſcandall, &amp; be a cauſe that the Catholike faith doth not ſo much increaſe as otherwiſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:489:158"/>
it would, I remit to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement of the prudent Reader.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>Lastly, and principally it is anſwered,</hi> that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and ſuch like texts of holy Scripture, wherein wee are forbid to giue any ſcandall either by word or deed which is euil, or hath in it ſhew and appearance of euil, they are to bee vnderſtood, as alſo wee haue inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted elſewhere,<note n="k" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. Anſwer nu. 87. and in the Preface to the ſame nu. 21.</note> not of <hi>paſſiue,</hi> as the Diuines do ſpeake or receiued ſcandall, but of <hi>actiue,</hi> and giuen ſcandal: to wit, that neither by word, nor deed we <hi>giue</hi> our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any cauſe of offending: but if any one by our good deed wil <hi>take</hi> ſcandal where it is not giuen, not we but himſelfe is to be blamed therfore. Yet in this al do agree that no action at al either belonging to doctrine or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is commanded by a iuſt Law, can bee a true &amp; ſufficient occaſion of ſcandal; &amp; if any one perchance be thereby ſcandalized, it is accounted by the Diuines to be a paſſiue, not actiue, a taken not giuen ſcandall.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Wherefore <hi>Alphonſus Salmeron</hi> a very learned Ieſuite, and one of the firſt ten by whoſe helpe that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was inſtituted, vpon that place of the Goſpell <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>Let them alone, they are blind, &amp;c.</hi> writeth thus: <hi>By theſe words we are inſtructed, that ſcandals taken by proper malice, (which we call paſſiue) are not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſcandall is rather permitted to ariſe, then the truth of Faith, or of life, or of iustice to be forſaken. For theſe ſorts of ſcandalls are, as we haue ſaid, called paſſiue, which another man through his owne frailty taketh by my good life, or by the faith and iuſtice which I embrace. But the ſcandall of the weake, or of the little ones is to be auoided, as our Sauiour Chriſt commanded, when he ſaid,</hi> Whoſoeuer ſhall ſcandalize one of theſe little ones &amp;c. <hi>Hee alſo by his owne example taught the ſame in this place; becauſe by theſe words he taught that the ſcandall of the Phariſees is not to bee regarded. Otherwiſe Chriſt ſhould neuer haue preached, nor the Catholike truth againſt heretikes, who were ſcandalized, haue beene defined. But the multitude he called vnto him, and instructed, and taught them that they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:489:158"/>
ſhould not bee ſcandalized. But if now and then there be ſome, who are not ſo capable of the truth, then if the doctrine or action which doth ſcandalize be not neceſſary, or very conuenient and profitable, we muſt yeeld ſomewhat to the weakeneſſe of the lttle ones. But if the great ones take this ſcandall, they are not to be regarded, for they are incurable, becauſe they are blind, that is, they will not ſee, and vnderſtand what God inſpireth in them, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. According therefore to this doctrine of <hi>Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> which alſo is the common of other Diuines, to make this argument, which is drawne from the nature of ſcandall, to haue any force, (to wit, <hi>that although this Oath of it ſelfe be not euill, yet there is in it no litle ſhew and appearance of euill, and therefore according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, we muſt refraine from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof)</hi> it muſt firſt bee proued that the taking of this <hi>Oath,</hi> and the acknowledging of the doctrine therein contained, is neither neceſſary, nor very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Catholikes, which doubtleſſe, ſuppoſing this Oath to be of it ſelfe lawfull, and that it is impoſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subiects by the command of the Prince, vnder very great penalties, our Aduerſaries will neuer be able to demonſtrate. For what exceeding great dangers Catholikes doe incurre if they refuſe it, and what great ſcandall ſo weake a confuting thereof doth giue to the Proteſtants, we haue ſufficiently ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And truely, if we once ſuppoſe that this <hi>Oath,</hi> is not vnlawfull, nor doth containe in it any thing flat contrary to faith and ſaluation, I doe not ſee with what ſhew of probability this argument which is taken from the ſcandall, can be vrged, ſeeing that now the greater part of Catholikes doe take it, neither can the taking thereof giue to Catholikes any other iuſt cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, then that other Catholikes by the example of theſe who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> ſhould alſo do the like, which if it be once granted to be lawfull, can giue to others no occaſion of offending. But if any <hi>great ones</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:489:159"/>
interpreting the <hi>Oath</hi> in an euill ſenſe, doe <hi>take occaſion</hi> of offending by their detractions, reproachful ſpeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and raſh iudgements, whiles they Iudge raſhly, and are not afraide openly to auoch, and doe with all their might endeauour to perſwade the common people, that thoſe Catholikes, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed their faith, are reuolted from their Religion, and are not to be accounted true Catholikes, but Apoſtates, the cauſe of their offending in this ſort, is not the taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> but either their owne ignorance, or malice, and therefore as <hi>Salmeron</hi> did very well ſay, as beeing blinde, and incurable, they are not to bee regarded. They hurt in deed greatly the good name, and credit of other men, but their owne conſciences they do wound more greeuouſly, and they are to remember, <hi>that the ſin is not forgiuen vnleſſe reſtitution be made:</hi> and that acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the moſt certaine rule of charity, and approued by all Diuines, doubtfull matters, and which may haue a good interpretation, are not to be interpreted in the worſer ſenſe, and much leſſe to be wreſted to that ſenſe which is moſt bad; which is now, I ſpeake it with grief, very frequent among ſome of our countrey men, who as ſoone as they doe perceiue any man to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt their opinions or actions, and not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour their proceedings, they are not afraide to aſſault him with all their power, to ſpeake of him reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to charge him with any wicked crimes, and to diuulge them among the commong people, although they haue their firſt beginning from ſome idle rumour, or from their owne meere ſuſpicion. Theſe be the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, from which the Apoſtle warneth vs to refraine, wherein there is not onely a ſhew or appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but which in deed are moſt wicked euils, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the lawes of charity and iuſtice, whereby the Catholike Religion is laughed to ſcorne, and by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries is greatly diſgraced.</p>

THe <hi>fourth obiection</hi> againſt the Oath in general is taken from the ill hap, and badde ſucceſſe which chanced to thoſe Prieſts who tooke the <hi>Oath,</hi> &amp; defended it to be lawfull. <hi>For the firſt Captaine of them</hi> Maſter Blackwell <hi>was taken away vpon the ſodaine and vnawares, and did alſo at the houre of his death, as ſome giue out, recall his former errour. An other alſo died ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly: two others reuolted from their faith; and the fifth liueth now in the houſe of the Biſhoppe of Wincheſter, and what in the end will become of him, may with iuſt cauſe be greatly feared, therefore by theſe examples other men may be forewarned, that they take heed how they take the Oath, or to defend that it may lawfully be taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this <hi>obiection</hi> it is <hi>anſwered firſt,</hi> that as it is not a ſufficient argument to proue ſuch a doctrine to be falſe, or ſuch an action to be vnlawfull, for that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by heretickes, when eſpecially true beleeuers do alſo defend the ſame, ſeeing that no hereticke doth in all points of faith diſſent from true beleeuers: So alſo it is not a ſufficient argument to proue, that this Oath, or any other action is vnlawfull, for that it was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by certaine Prieſts, who then were Catholikes, but now are reuolted from the Catholike faith, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if other Catholikes who ſtill perſiſt in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, doe with all their might defend the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the bad ſucceſſe of ſome few Prieſts who haue defended the Oath bee a ſufficient reaſon to condemne it as vnlawfull, by an argument from the contrary, as the <hi>Logicians</hi> tearme it, alſo the bad ſucceſſe of ſome Prieſts, who haue beene vehement againſt the <hi>Oath,</hi> is a ſufficient cauſe to proue it to be lawfull, but not onely ſome few Prieſts who haue taught that the <hi>Oath</hi> is lawfull, but alſo who haue exceedingly exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:489:160"/>
againſt the <hi>oath,</hi> haue had ſomewhat bad ſucceſſes; as may appeare by three Prieſts, to ſay nothing of Lay men, who liued in the North parts of this Realme: Whereof one being a man otherwiſe very healthie, was ſo ſodainlie ſtricken with a deadly diſeaſe, that ſcarce ſixteene howres before his death hee feared any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all; an other falling downe a paire of ſtaires, was bruſed in ſuch ſort that hee liued not long after<note n="*" place="margin">Another lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in haſte ouer an hedge fel into a pit, which was on the other ſide the hedge, and o was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note>: the third, who did the moſt vehemently of them all enueigh againſt the <hi>Oath,</hi> as ſoone as hee was taken by the officers, and brought before the Magiſtrate to be examined, did not onely refuſe to take euen the <hi>Oath</hi> of the <hi>Kings Supremacie</hi> in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, but alſo as it were in an inſtant before hee was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon, hee did to the great admiration of all thoſe who were preſent, vtterly reuolt from that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, which for many yeares before hee had profeſſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the euill ſucceſſe of ſome few Prieſts, who haue defended the lawfulneſſe of the <hi>Oath,</hi> bee a ſufficient reaſon to proue it to be vnlawfull, by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo from the contrary the good ſucceſſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prieſts, who haue taught it to bee lawfull, is alſo a ſufficient reaſon to proue that it may lawfully be taken. But our Aduerſaries will not, as I ſuppoſe, deny, but that Maſter <hi>Drury</hi> and Father <hi>Roberts</hi> the firſt a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſt, and the other a Religious of the Order of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> made both of them happy ends; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe it is knowne to all men, that Maſter <hi>Drury</hi> as ſoone as the <hi>Oath</hi> was publiſhed, did euen to the laſt gaſpe openly maintaine the ſame, and this hee did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely proteſt at his Arraignement before the Iudge and all the ſtanders by, whereof there was a very great multitude: And neuertheleſſe he being deſirous to dye for that cauſe, for which hee was condemned by the Iudge, did himſelfe refuſe to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> euen to ſaue his owne life, which was freely offered him by the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:489:160"/>
Iudge, if hee would take the ſame, beeing aſſuredly perſwaded by the aduiſe of ſome whom I could name, that neither hee, nor any other Prieſt, (for concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lay-men hee was of an other opinion) by reaſon of the diuerſitie of opinions which were then freſhly begunne among Catholikes, concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Oath,</hi> was bound in conſcience to take the ſame, although he thought vndoubtedly and alſo auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſame, that any man whatſoeuer might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Likewiſe</hi> it is alſo certaine, that although Father <hi>Roberts,</hi> did not publikely teach that the <hi>Oath</hi> was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> by his <hi>Breues,</hi> had declared the contrary, and had commanded the Engliſh Prieſts, not to teach that it might lawfully bee taken, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe euen vntill death, hee perſeuered in this opinion, that there was nothing contained in the Oath, which was contrary to faith or ſaluation, neither would hee put any ſcruple into the mindes of his ghoſtly children concerning the refuſing of the ſame. For two principall reaſons (as hee hath oftentimes acknowledged to my ſelfe and others) he was perſwaded that the Oath might lawfully be taken; <hi>the firſt</hi> was, for that hee could not yet perceiue, that thoſe learned men, who had written againſt it, had hitherto ſufficiently proued, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thing, which was contrary to faith or ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>The other</hi> was, that when he was at <hi>Paris,</hi> he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the opinions of two moſt learned Diuines of that nation, concerning the lawfulneſſe of the Oath, and at length through his great intreatie, they gaue him this anſwere, that they for their owne parts had not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obſerued in it any thing which might not be taken, and that ſcarce any ſubiect of the King of <hi>France,</hi> as they thought, would ſtagger to take the like Oath, if it were by publike authority, commanded them vnder ſo great penalties: And that this is moſt true, hee hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times proteſted to me, and many others, and his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:489:161"/>

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, to ſay ſomewhat in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concerning thoſe perſons, who are touched in the obiection, firſt of all it is falſe, that Maſter <hi>Blakwell</hi> did euer recall his opinion concerning the lawfull taking of the <hi>oath;</hi> but, as it ſhall preſently appeare, did euen to his laſt houre perſiſt therein. His death may doubtleſſe in ſome ſort be called <hi>ſodaine,</hi> for that very few houres he lay ſick in bed, neither did hee expect any certaine day or moneth when he ſhould dye, before almoſt the very laſt houre of his departure. Yet becauſe both in regarde of his olde age, his ſpirits almoſt exhauſted, the vnſound conſtitution of his body, and eſpecially of an extraordinary ſhortneſſe of breath, and diuerſe obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wherewith hee was continually oppreſſed, hee oftentimes and ſeriouſly auouched to mee and others, that hee ſhould for the aforeſaid cauſes be taken away <hi>ſodainly,</hi> and therefore hauing death in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, his death although it may be called <hi>ſodaine,</hi> yet doubtleſſe it came not <hi>vnawares</hi> and <hi>vnexpected.</hi> In this manner therefore he departed this life. Vpon a Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday<note n="l" place="margin">Being the 25. of Ianuary. 1612.</note> in the after noone hee went downe from his chamber to make his confeſſion, as vſually he was wont to doe, which after hee had ended, and departing from the chamber of his ghoſtly Father, he perceiued a great faintneſſe, and a diſpoſition to ſowneing to grow vpon him, but a litle after hee came into a more pure and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen aire, hee found himſelfe farre better. After hee was come to his owne chamber, he fel into a ſodaine ſowne, but by the diligence of thoſe Prieſts, who incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were preſent, he was brought to himſelfe againe, and after he had put off his cloathes, and was laid in bed, he humbly craued thoſe Eccleſiaſticall rites, which vſually are giuen to thoſe who are extremely ſick, if they ſhould iudge it requiſite. And being demanded by a certaine
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:489:161"/>
Prieſt, what his opinion was now concerning the <hi>Oath,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>that he did that which ſeemed to him more probable, that he had done nothing againſt his conſcience, and that euen now he continued in the ſame opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the lawfulneſſe of the Oath, which he had heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mantained.</hi> Afterwards diuers Prieſts hearing of his ſodaine ſicknes came to his chamber, and then hee earneſtly requeſted <hi>the whole world and all them who were preſent,</hi> and eſpecially one by name, with whom in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times he was in great controuerſie, <hi>to pardon him, if he had offended them in any thing,</hi> and proteſted, <hi>that he was a child of the Catholike Romane Church, and that he ſo intended to dye. And as for opinions, that he followed his conſcience, and that which ſeemed to him iuſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, yet if he had offended God in any thing, that he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly askt him forgiueneſſe.</hi> Which ſpeech being ended, he falling into a ſowne againe, ſo departed this life. By which asking God forgiueneſſe can not be gathered, that he had any doubtfull, but rather a pious and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſcience, <hi>it being the part of pious mindes,</hi> as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great, <hi>there alſo in ſome ſort to acknowledge a fault where there is no fault,</hi> and yet hee did not abſolutely acknowledge this fault, for that hee found not himſelfe guiltie thereof, but <hi>conditionally</hi> if peraduenture hee had offended, he humbly requeſted God to clenſe him from his hidden ſinnes. I omit to ſpeake how religious, and without blame his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was after hee had taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> for of this all thoſe who haue liued with him in priſon, can giue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Concerning Maſter <hi>Iackson,</hi> it is true doubtleſſe, as it is thought, that hee dyed of the plague. But haue not alſo very many holy men, as Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> King of France dyed of the ſame diſeaſe? But what if he did get that infection by doing ſome good and charitable worke, as Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> did in that warre againſt the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racines,</hi> may wee rightly from hence conclude, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:489:162"/>
by reaſon of the ill ſucceſſe which followed, if it ought to bee called euill, to be vnlawfull? He dyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as it is credibly thought, of that infection, but his death was not vnexpected, for day by day hee looked when hee ſhould depart this world, and being ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with all the Sacraments of holy Church, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelfe euery minute of an houre to dye.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Warmington,</hi> ſo the caſe ſtands. After he had written a booke in defence of the <hi>Oath,</hi> he was wholy depriued of that common Almes, which from the beneuolence of ſome good perſons, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſent to thoſe, who are detained in priſon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he being depriued, and hauing no other thing to prouide him neceſſaries for his ſuſtenance beſides the beneuolence of pious men, hee moſt clearly perceiued, that if hee ſhould remaine any long time in priſon, hee ſhould be in danger to periſh of famine; neither did he thinke it ſafe for him to goe beyond the Seas (although perchance he might haue obtained leaue of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to depart the Realme) for that he was accounted by theſe vehement impugners of the <hi>Oath</hi> to be a ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, an heretike and an Apoſtata. He being therefore in this diſtreſſe, and withall perſwading himſelfe, that by taking or defending the <hi>Oath</hi> he had committed no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he thought hee had no other remedy to deliuer him from extreme beggery, then to make humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to his Maieſtie, that out of his Princely commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he would be pleaſed to beſtow vpon him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereby his extreme want might be relieued: eſpecially, ſeeing that the chiefeſt cauſe of his miſery and pouertie was, for that he had publikely by word &amp; writing profeſſed himſelfe to be a faithful and conſtant ſubiect vnto his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> Whoſe petition his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> mercifully granting, wrote his letters to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that he would prouide him in his owne houſe thoſe things which were neceſſary for his reliefe. Which anſwere Maſter <hi>Warmington</hi> hauing receiued,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:489:162"/>
was exceedingly troubled, as he proteſted to all the Prieſts who were in that priſon, doubting that his abode in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> his houſe, would giue ſome ſcandall to weake Catholikes. But after he had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſidered the matter, and calling to his minde that ancient prouerbe, <hi>that beggers muſt be no chooſers,</hi> leaſt that not being contented with that which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, they get nothing at all, he thought it his beſt courſe of two euils to chooſe the leſſer, and to accept of the condition which was offered him by his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and by that meanes to preſerue his life, which by lawfull waies the law of nature doth giue vs leaue to doe, then by miſerable famine, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dying, to pine away in priſon, Aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading his conſcience with the common opinion of Diuines, that a thing of it ſelfe lawfull, if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea and alſo according to <hi>Salmeron</hi> if it be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, can be a iuſt occaſion of any ſcandall giuen.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wherefore although that ſentence of Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, no man is hurt, but by himſelfe,</hi> be moſt true, and euery man ought rather to ſuffer whatſoeuer calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then to forſake his faith; neuertheleſſe, if any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, either ſpirituall or temporall, hath afterwards fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to them who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> it ought not to be imputed to the taking of the <hi>Oath,</hi> which being of it ſelfe lawfull, can be no iuſt cauſe of any ſpirituall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, but rather it is to be attributed to the immoderate detractions, backbytings, perſecutions, and vnchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anlike proceedings of ſome, who are ſo vehement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Prieſts, who haue taken the <hi>oath,</hi> or taught it to be lawfull, as to a more immediate cauſe. And truly if this argument drawne from the bad ſucceſſe of ſome Prieſts, be ſufficient to proue the <hi>Oath</hi> vnlawfull, in the like manner it might be proued, that any iuſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whatſoeuer is euill and vniuſt, if one for it ſhould be perſecuted and brought into great miſeries, and ſo at the length thereby to forſake his Religion, and become
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:489:163"/>
an Apoſtata. As for example, if a Catholike Prieſt, being wrongfully oppreſſed by his Biſhop, ſhould lawfully appeale to the Metropolitan, and comming to his court for redreſſe, ſhould not onely finde there no ſuccour, and eaſing of his vexation, but alſo by reaſon of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of his Biſhop, and the euill information which he hath giuen againſt him, ſhould there be vſed farre more hardly then before, ſhould be caſt into priſon, be ſuſpended from vſing his Orders, and enjoying his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, and at the laſt ſhould be confined into ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Land, and he ſeeing ſuch bad dealing, ſhould deſperatly forſake the Catholike faith, and become a runnagate to the aduerſaries thereof, were it lawfull, I pray you, to conclude from hence, that the appeale of this Catholike Prieſt, by reaſon of the bad ſucceſſe, was vniuſt, or that his reuolting from his faith, is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his iuſt appeale, or rather to the iniquitie of his Biſhop vniuſtly oppreſſing him? The chiefeſt cauſe doubtleſſe of his Apoſtacie, was either his owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, or malice, but no ſmall occaſion alſo of his fall is to be aſcribed to his vniuſt vexation, neither is his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full appeale to be accounted any cauſe or occaſion at all of reuolting from his faith. And this very ſame may in ſome ſort be applyed to thoſe Prieſts, who after they had taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> and taught it to be lawfull, beeing exceedingly enueighed againſt, accounted no others then Apoſtates, and depriued of the common beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which relieued their wants, did at the length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt from their faith.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Finally,</hi> all that which at the moſt can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, from the bad ſucceſſe of ſome few Prieſts, who haue taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> is this, that euery one who hath, any doubt concerning the lawfull taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> ought diligently to examine all, and euery clauſe thereof, but doubtleſſe no ſufficient argument can be drawen from the bad ſucceſſe, and euill euent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Oath</hi> to bee vnlawfull, and that with a

                                 <hi>BEing in my iourney towards London, in</hi> Standford in <hi>the countye of</hi> Lincolne, about the ſpace of fiue or ſixe houres <hi>with</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sutton <hi>in my company, I was vpon the ſodaine in the ſtreete ſtaid by the Constables for hauing beaten an Iriſh boy which attended vpon mee, who ſaid alſo, there was other matters to be laid to me; and my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on adioyning himſelfe vnto me, and expostulating the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them about my apprehenſion, we were both commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Towne Hall vpon</hi> Sunday the 29. of Auguſt, <hi>where we continued vntill Wedneſday following, hauing no bed to lye vpon, and for the ſpace of foure and twenty houres hauing no meat allowed vs to eat; and vpon the Wedneſday we were both brought before the</hi> Earle of Exceſter, who finding no matter of accuſation againſt vs, wee were both ſet at liberty. In the mean time ſearching the place where we lay, they found a <hi>Primmer and a payre of beads and thereupon the Friday following wee were both againe brought before my Lord, who firſt demanded of</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sutton <hi>whether he was a Papist, to which he anſwered, hee might as well proue him an Atheiſt as a Papiſt; then he asked him whoſe were the booke and beads, to the which he anſwered, that they were his, and that he had kept them for the loue of a Gentlewoman, which once gaue him the booke and beads, and that for her ſake he had kept them; and then beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether he would take the Oath of Allegiance, he deſired at the first to be excuſed, for that hee had taken it before, but in fine being vrged againe, he tooke it according
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:489:164"/>
to the statute, and the ſame being propoſed vnto me, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red time to conſider of it, becauſe I neuer peruſed it, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with any Catholicke about it, which was giuen mee for the ſpace of two daies, whereupon I was committed to the Towne-Hall againe, and my companion with me, becauſe he could not bring bayle, as the Conſtables required, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before my Lord, that wee might both bee bound to the peace. Being returned to the Towne-Hall, and diſcourſing together with my companion, hee demanded what wee ſhould haue to Supper, I told him I was not wont to ſup on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, and that I would haue nothing but a few peares, and a cup of water, to which hee anſwered that hee would take ſuch part as I did; and ſo eating of thoſe peares, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king water together, he tould me that it was the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſupper, that euer he had eaten; and hee deſired alſo to waſh himſelfe with that water which was brought vp in a bucket for vs. And entring into ſome diſcourſe with my companion about the Oath, alledging my reaſon why I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take it, he anſwered that he had neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered of the matter, but that he had done as he ſaw others do; whereupon I betooke my ſelfe to my deuotions, deſiring almighty God to direct me in my anſwere, when I ſhould be called next before my Lord; and ſo ſpent about the ſpace of three houres or more vpon my knees commending my ſelfe to God, and to all the holy Saints of heauen, and in particular to the Bleſſed Virgin of whoſe glorious aſſumption in body into Heauen I ſuffered at that time ſome ſcruple &amp; diſtraction in my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and alſo another ſcruple I ſuffered about the prayers of Saints, whether they were auaileable for mee or not, which distraction I deſired almighty God to put away from mee, I finding my ſelfe troubled therewith in my prayers.</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:489:165"/>
companion began to riſe out of the bed, crying out he was a damned wicked wretch, onely for taking the Oath, and how happy are you, ſaid he, that are to receiue ſuch heauenly comfort by hauing only taken time to think of it, deſiring me to pray for him. Then I willed him to make the ſigne of the croſſe, which he did willingly, and then crept downe into the bed, ſaying that he durſt not looke vp to behold the viſion which was for me to looke vpon, but deſired me to pray for him, ſaying that he was onely to be a witneſſe of the fauour which God vouchſafed to doe forme; and ſo lifting vp mine eies I ſaw the roome where wee were ſhining with a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſplendent light, and brightneſſe, and with all the myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity was repreſented to my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with greate comfort; and after this there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the B.

This viſion of our Lady and the angels continued about the ſpace of halfe an houre, and a little before they vaniſhed away, there appeared alſo a multitude of holy Saints and Martyrs offering vp as it were incenſe vnto almighty God, which I conceiued to be the fruit of thoſe prayers wherewith I recommended my ſelfe vnto them; and me thought they ſaid vnto mee, double thy deuotion vnto the Saints, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more acceptable vnto almighty God: New for the time of this viſion both my ſelfe and my companion were without the vſe of our tongues, I looking vpon the Bleſſed Virgin and the Angels and Saints then appearing, and hee crowching downe in the bed as fearing to looke vpon them; but the viſion being ended our ſpeech returned vnto vs, and I begun to cry with a loude voice</hi> Alleluia, gloria &amp;c.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:489:165"/>
                                 <hi>which my companion did alſo in like manner, vttering thoſe prayers which neuer in all his life hee could ſay nor ſcarſe vnderſtand, as I thinke before that time, ſaying vnto mee, that now hee was taught how to pray, and ſo we continued the ſpace of three houres or thereabouts, crying out with ſo loud a voice, that we were heard more then a furlong off from that place; and diuers of the towne hearing vs came neere vnto vs, and cryed out againſt vs vſing words vnto vs which I doe not remember. Thus wee continued for the ſpace of three or foure houres, ſo long as the light continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the roome, being not able in all this time to riſe out of our bed: And in the morning the keeper with ſome others brought vs againe vnto my Lord, telling him how wee had cryed out all that night, &amp; called vpon the Saints, &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them a paper, which as ſoone as wee were ryſen out of our bed, wee had written of that viſion, which appeared vnto vs, which I did by the perſwaſion of Maſter</hi> Sutton, <hi>who told me that hee was a witneſſe of all that had appeared vnto vs &amp; that it appeared principally to me and to him alſo for his better inſtructions in Religion; as alſo of his fathers and friends, and that hee might be a witneſſe of the fauour which God had ſhewed mee, and ſo appearing againe before my Lord, and being demanded of the viſion wee both confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and as well he iuſtified the truth of that Religion, whereunto he was called, and I alſo the like, confirming alſo the doctrine of prayer to Saints by many places of Scripture, as alſo the aſſumption of our Bleſſed Lady in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to the which purpoſe I alleadged the place in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips ca.</hi> 12. ſignum magnum in coelo, <hi>the which place I neuer had ſeene, or heard before in all my life, but that time I vttered as readily as if I had ſeen it before mine eies.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:489:166"/>
ſpeeches of the Diuell, and ſuch like, he became diſtracted of his wits, and ſo remaineth for any thing that I know; though for two daies after this viſion vpon my knowledge he was not only in perfect ſenſe, but very ciuill and modest and much reclaimed from ſwearing, and other diſorderly behauiour, and finding him about eight daies after in</hi> Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, <hi>though otherwiſe hee ſeemed diſtracted, yet to me he ſpake very ſenſible, and deſired to haue priuate ſpeech with me, which would not be permitted.</hi>

                  <p n="16">16 Secondly, <hi>in the examining of ſpirits, we muſt not only regard the perſon who hath viſions, but alſo the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the viſions; if all things euen to the leaſt propoſition be true, for that falſhood is not in the ſpirit of truth, but in the ſpirit of lying there be ſometimes a thouſand manifest truths, that in one only hidden falſhood he may deceiue.

very prudently; and circumſpectly: and eſpecially in the beginning let him conſider diligently for what end this perſon is mooued to make known his ſecret: whereupon this conſideration may be made. Be warie therefore whoſoeuer thou be that art a hearer, or counſailer, that thou doe not applaude ſuch a perſon, nor commend him, or admire him as a holie man, and worthy of ſuch reuelations, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; gainsſay him rather, rebuke him ſharpely, reuile him whoſe heart is ſo haughtie, and eies ſo loftie, that he walketh in great and wonderfull matters aboue himſelfe, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to himſelfe worthie not to worke his ſaluation as other men do, to wit, by the doctrine of holy Scriptures and Saints, with the dictamen or iudgement of naturall reaſon.

Wherefore if without any reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one may by humane vnderſtanding attaine to that, which is ſaid to haue beene reuealed, that reuelation is to be ſuſpected and ſuperfluous, and not neceſſary</hi>

                  <p n="20">20. Sixthly, <hi>in the examining of ſpirits we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from whence the ſpirite doth come, or whether it doth goe, and how he doth inſinuate himſelfe. For the euill ſpirit doth inſinuate himſelfe to them who goe forward in vertue, harſhly, vnpleaſantly, and violently,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Detrius ſect. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>as it were with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vehemency as a ſhower of raine falling vpon ſtones: but the good ſpirit doth inſinuate himſelfe to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſoftly, pleaſantly, and ſweetly, as water doth wet a ſpunge. But with them who goe backward, experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:489:171"/>
that it falleth out quite contrarie. Therefore S.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>doth witneſſe,</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Gerſon. loc. cit.</note> 
                     <hi>that he had not this gift giuen him to know this in himſelfe, to wit, from whence the ſpirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, or whether it goeth, who neuertheleſſe humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he often times perceiued the preſence of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit by an inward motion of the hart or mind. Therefore perchance one will wonder, how a perſon of an inferiour ſtate can ſay, that he oftentimes doth diſcerne, from whenee the ſpirit commeth, eſpecially ſeeing that Chriſt ſaid to</hi> Nicodemus,<note n="r" place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> Thou heareſt his voice, but thou knoweſt not whence he commeth, and whether he goeth. <hi>And moreouer in diuers ſpirits there is to be ſeene a great ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in inſpirations. For God is a ſpirit, a good Angell is a ſpirit, a bad Angell is a ſpirit, there is alſo a humane ſpirit, both reaſonable and ſenſuall. And the like viſion may be inſpired by euery one of theſe ſpirits, although in a different manner, but by reaſon of ſome ſimilitude the difference can not eaſily be perceiued by them, who are not skilfull in ſuch things, who neither of themſelues by their ſharpneſſe of wit, neither by their learning in Diuinitie, or naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, nor by the inſtruction from others doe know how to diſtinguiſh them. Neither doubtleſſe is it to be meruailed at, ſeeing that we find very few men, who doe perfectly know how to diſcerne the cogitations and affections of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule as it is reaſonable, from thoſe which are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, to wit, which are in the common ſenſe, or in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane of the phantaſie. Whom, I pray you, will you finde of thoſe men who feare God, and fley from ſinne, who alwaies and in all things doth clearly perceiue, when temptations doe abound, whether he hath onely ſome ſenſualitie in his imagination, or alſo ſome conſent in his reaſon? So hard a matter it is to diſcerne ſenſualitie, or a ſenſuall delight from conſent. How much more difficult a matter is it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe foure ſpirits before mentioned, to wit, when a vehement inſtinct, or inſpiration commeth to our minde, whether it be from God, from a good Angell, or a bad, or from our owne proper humane ſpirit, of which alſo there are
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:489:172"/>
two parts or portions the ſuperiour, or</hi> reaſonable, <hi>and the inferiour or</hi> ſenſuall <hi>part? The diſtinction of which two to diſcerne perfectly, is onely granted by that word of God which doth pearce euen to the diuiding of the ſpirit &amp; ſoule, which deuiſion ſhe found in her ſelfe, who cryed out,</hi> My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, <hi>and then deuiding the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from the ſoule, ſhe added,</hi> and my ſpirit hath reioyced in God my Sauiour.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Laſtly, <hi>to make triall whether this ſpirit commeth from God,</hi>

                     <hi>we muſt examine the cogitations, which went before, or followed the reuelation. For from the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of former things may eaſily proceed a phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call illuſion. To one who is troubled and toſſed with euill thoughts, the holy ſpirit or a true reuelation doth neuer come: and neuertheleſſe a true and diuine reuelation doth not alwaies follow a good and holy thought. For in the very feruour of praier, the Diuell many times doth endeauour to creepe in. After a true reuelation good deſires, and good effects doe alwaies follow, and ſometimes accidentally, and for a time alſo good effects do follow an illuſion, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe are by the Diuell referred to a greater euill.

                     <note n="u" place="margin">In the places aboue cited.</note>, who very well compareth<note n="x" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. By this which hath been ſaid, it is manifeſt, that very great diligence is to be vſed, and much examining is to be made both by him, who is ſaid to haue had an apparition, and alſo by others who are to iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, before we publiſh any viſion as a diuine reuelation, eſpecially if it be alleadged to confirme any doctrine, leaſt that otherwiſe wee broach a falſe or vncertaine doctrine for an vndoubted truth; for the precious coine of a heauenly viſion, we fell hay, ſtraw, and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall illuſions, and vnder a faire ſhew and colour of godlineſſe, wee throw headlong into dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours deuout people, who are ouer much giuen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue pretended viſions and miracles. Now what great diligence, and what meanes both Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> who ſaith, that he ſaw this viſion, and alſo thoſe to whom he did diſcloſe it, haue vſed in examining thereof, to wit, whether it was a true apparition or a phantaſticall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, a diuine reuelation, or a diabolicall illuſion, it is not as yet knowen to me. But verily if that bee true which is reported, they were too headlong in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing thereof, ſeeing that both Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> as himſelfe affirmeth, did by the perſwaſion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> a Proteſtant, preſently put it downe in writing, and ſhewed it to others, and alſo thoſe to whom hee did diſcloſe it, doubted not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and without any more examing, to publiſh it as a true reuelation. But how ſeeuer it was, there are diuers ſtrong arguments drawne from the aforeſaid rules, which doe probably ſhew, that it was not a heauenly reuelation.</p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:489:173"/>23. And firſt of all, although it may fall out, that one for lucre, vaine glory, or for ſome other priuate, or in his iudgement alſo publike commoditie may of ſet purpoſe forge falſe miracles and reuelations, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Berna</hi> in <hi>Swizerland</hi>

                  <p n="24">24. For firſt it is ſufficiently knowen, that both of them were very young men, and that in priſon, as in the relation we read, they were hardly vſed, and therefore both for want of foode, and lacke of ſleepe, they (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not eaten for twentie foure houres any meate at all, nor ſleept in any bed for many dayes) might eaſily ſuffer ſome harme and craſineſſe in their imagination<note n="*" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Newton</hi> himſelfe in his relation, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth the phrenſie of Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> to his hard v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, want of ſleepe, &amp;c. Why then might not alſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Newton</hi> for the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in his imagination at the time of that pretended viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</note>. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the relation affirmeth that Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> was ſodainly awaked out of his ſleepe by the outcries of his companion Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> a Proteſtant, who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>that he was a damned wicked wretch, only for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Oath,</hi> and who alſo had before a weake, not to ſay, a craſie braine, (for not long after hee was cleane diſtracted of his wits, as Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) and therefore it was a very eaſie matter for Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> through a vehement apprehenſion of the viſion, which Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> did foretell him, being yet ſcarce fully awake, ſhould inſtantly appeare vnto him, to imagine that hee ſaw, and heard that, which in very deed he neither ſaw nor heard, which oftentimes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:489:173"/>
happeneth alſo to them that be awake, as wee before haue noted. And doubtleſſe it is euident by the relation it ſelfe, that the apparition was onely imaginary, for as much as concerneth the words, which Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> affirmeth he did heare. For although he ſaith, that he <hi>ſaw the bleſſed Virgin, with an infinite number of Angels about her, and that there appeared vnto him a multitude of holy Saints,</hi> yet when hee repeateth the words that they ſpake vnto him, hee doth not abſolutely ſay, that they ſpake this or that vnto him, <hi>But I thought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the bleſſed Virgin ſpake to me in this manner, Behold, ſee and beleeue my Aſſumption in body, and withall ſaid, take not the Oath, but rather endure all torments, &amp;c.</hi> And a litle after, <hi>Me thought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Saints ſaid vnto me, Double thy deuotion vnto the Saints, for nothing is more acceptable vnto almightie God.</hi> So that all the certaintie of this reuelation dependeth vpon the ſole cogitation and imagination of a young man, who is neither a Saint nor learned, nor exerciſed in contemplatiue life; which kind of teſtimonie, to knowe what authoritie it can beare for giuing credit to a viſion, I remit the Reader to that, which wee haue before related out of <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Delrius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. But be it as it will, let this viſion be reall, let it be imaginary (for vndoubtedly both wayes Almightie God may appeare to men, either immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or by his Angels and Saints) neuertheleſſe there be many probable ſignes, which according to the rules before ſet downe, doe plainly ſhew, partly that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation may bee iuſtly ſuſpected, and partly that it was no diuine apparition, but a meere illuſion. For <hi>firſt</hi> it is knowen that Maſter <hi>Sutton,</hi> who foretold Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> that he ſhould haue an apparition, and ſo was the firſt man to whom the viſion was reuealed, was not onely no Catholike, but alſo, as is gathered by Maſter <hi>Newtons</hi> relation, was much giuen to ſwearing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſorderly behauiour. It is alſo manifeſt that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

                     <hi>Newton</hi> was not onely a Nouice in the courſe of ſpirituall life, but alſo not well confirmed in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, ſeeing that, as appeareth by his relation, hee doubted of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the bleſſed Virgin, and alſo of the lawfull praying to Saints.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Beſides, many things are in Maſter <hi>Newtons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which doe not ſeeme to bee agreeable to truth. And <hi>firſt</hi> thoſe things doe not hang well together, which are ſaid of Maſter <hi>Sutton,</hi> to wit, <hi>that he was to be a witneſſe of the fauour which God vouchſafed to doe far Master Newton,</hi> conſidering that Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> did neither heare, nor ſee almoſt any thing of that appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof he could be either an eare or an eie-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For Maſter <hi>Sutton,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affirmeth, <hi>crept downe into the bed, ſaying, that he durſt not looke vp to behold the viſion, which was for me to looke vpon, but deſired me to pray for him, ſaying that hee was onely to be a witneſſe of the fauour, which God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to doe for me, and ſo lifting vp my eies, I ſaw the roome ſhining, &amp;c.</hi> Now thoſe things, which were ſpoken by the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and the holy <hi>Saints,</hi> vnto Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> hee did not heare with his corporall eare, but with his inward imagination. <hi>I thought,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that the bleſſed Virgin ſpake vnto me, Take not the Oath, &amp;c. Mee thought the Saints ſaid vnto mee, Double thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that alſo is falſe, which in this reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> affirmed, to wit, <hi>that he was a damned wretch only for taking the Oath,</hi> ſeeing that, as appeareth by the relation, hee had committed many other youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinnes, for the which he deſerued damnation. And although in ſome later copies that word <hi>[onely]</hi> is now raſed out, yet for certaintie in the firſt copies, whereof many are yet extant, that word <hi>[onely]</hi> is expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> thoſe words, <hi>Double thy deuotion to the Saints, for there is nothing more acceptable to almightie God,</hi> ſpoken generally are not alſo agreeable to truth,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:489:174"/>
for that it is euident, that charitie, which is a Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertue, to ſpeake nothing of other vertues, is more acceptable to God, then deuotion vnto the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that this apparition was not a diuine reuelation, but an illuſion, is alſo proued by the effect thereof. For, beſides that madneſſe and phrenſineſſe do ſeldome follow diuine conſolations and reuelations, as it happened to Maſter <hi>Sutton,</hi> (vnleſſe that one wil ſay, that before that reuelation hee was diſtracted of his wits, from whence a farre ſtronger argument may bee drawen to diſproue this reuelation) Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> himſelfe againſt the expreſſe prohibition of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> did take the <hi>Oath,</hi> as the <hi>Biſhop of Peterborow,</hi> who did tender it vnto him, and many others, who were preſent, doe conſtantly affirme.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:489:175"/>
it is not credible, that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> would by the mouth of Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> to proue the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> alleage ſuch a place of Scripture, which according to the doctrine of Catholike Diuines is no conuincing proofe, but according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine of Diuines, the literall ſenſe of that place is not to be vnderſtood of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> but of the holy Church, and no text of holy Scripture according to the myſticall or allegoricall ſenſe thereof, vnleſſe by ſome other place of Scripture it bee declared to be that ſenſe, but onely according to the literall ſenſe, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient argument to proue a poſition or doctrine of faith.

                  <p n="2">2.

For no Catholike Diuine, as I ſuppoſe, wil contend with <hi>Suarez,</hi> that hee can not bring ſome <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

arguments</hi> to proue the <hi>Oath</hi> vnlawfull, and to containe more then Ciuill Obedience; but the onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thoſe, who defend the <hi>Oath,</hi> is to ſhew by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable arguments and anſweres,</hi> that the reaſons, which <hi>Suarez,</hi> or any other hitherto hath brought to proue, that the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall Primacie, or any other vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing is denyed in this <hi>Oath,</hi> are not ſo <hi>cleare, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and demonſtratiue,</hi> but that <hi>probable anſweres</hi> may be made vnto them, and conſequently that Catholikes may with a <hi>probable,</hi> and therefore with a <hi>ſafe conſcience</hi> according to the doctrine of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> before related take the ſame. And therefore I purpoſely ſaid, that <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> did in part propound the ſtate of the queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, vnderſtanding of the <hi>modall</hi> and not of the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute propoſition,</hi> as I haue declared.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The true ſtate of the controuerſie now beeing known, the chiefe &amp; maine ground, whereon all <hi>Suarez</hi> his arguments againſt the <hi>Oath</hi> doe principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, is the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and to diſpoſe of all their temporals, of lands, goods, bodies &amp; liues.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Sauiour Christ hath giuen to Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>and his ſucceſſours authoritie to correct, and puniſh all wicked chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, euen</hi> alſo Kings, <hi>who alſo are Chriſts ſheepe, but this power to correct and puniſh he hath not limited to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall cenſures, therefore it ought not to be limited by vs, or any Prince of the Church, but it belongeth to the Pope to appoint, and determine the puniſhment, as occaſion, and neceſſitie ſhall require.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition hath before in the ſame chapter beene by <hi>Suarez</hi> ſufficiently proued. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> he proueth thus, <hi>For the words of Christ, Feede my ſheepe are indefinite, therefore, for as much as the power to correct and puniſh which is neceſſary in euery ſheepheard is included in that word [Feede,] that power to correct is not determined to Cenſures, but it is left to be determined to this or that puniſhment, by prudence and equitie. For euery Sheepheard hath power to correct his ſheepe, not according to any determinate manner in generall, but as it ſhall be conuenient and expedient for the ſheepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this Obiection I haue at large anſwered in my Apologie, it beeing the ſelfe ſame argument which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vrged in the very like manner.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:489:181"/>
equiuocation, or mentall reſeruation declare vnto vs two things. The <hi>first,</hi> whether in his conſcience hee be certainly perſwaded, that both himſelfe and all other Catholikes are bound vnder paine of hereſie, or errour, from which by no probable reaſons which can mooue them to the contrary they can bee excuſed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that this text of holy Scripture, or any other doth euidently conuince the Popes power to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the <hi>ſecond,</hi> whether with the ſame certainty al ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes are bound to beleeue, &amp; embrace this doctrine which <hi>Suarez,</hi> affirmeth<note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 3. nu. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>to be true and certaine,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath alſo authority to kill Kings, and to giue leaue to others to kill them. For his reaſon out of this place of holy Scripture is indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both to depoſing &amp; killing, becauſe Chriſt did not limit that power, which hee gaue to the <hi>Pope</hi> to correct and chaſtiſe, rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing then to killing, but hee left it to the <hi>Pope</hi> to appoint, and determine it according to prudence and equitie, as occaſion and neceſſitie ſhould require. Yea and that example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> which <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> bringeth a litle beneath, doth proue more ſtrongly his authority to kill, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Ananias,</hi> then to depoſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the argument therefore I grant, that Chriſt by theſe words, <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi> did appoint S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the ſpirituall Paſtour of his Church, which is his myſticall bodie, and not a temporall, but a ſpirituall Common-wealth, and conſequently hee gaue him all ſpirituall power, which is ſufficient and neceſſary for the gouernement of this ſpirituall Common-wealth, and this is all that can bee directly and clearely infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this place; but what authoritie is ſpirituall, and what temporall, what ſpirituall authoritie to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh is neceſſary and ſufficient for the gouerning of a ſpirituall common-wealth, and whether it be limited to inflict onely ſpirituall puniſhments according to the nature of a ſpirituall Common-wealth, (for that euery
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:489:181"/>
common-wealth of her owne nature hath authoritie to puniſh her ſubiects offending, by depriuing them of the goods and priuiledges of that Common-wealth) or it is alſo extended to depoſing, killing, and all other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, can not bee ſufficiently gathered from theſe words, <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi> but it muſt be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from ſome other diſcourſe grounded vpon reaſon or other authorities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. My opinion is, that by no humane diſcourſe grounded either vpon reaſon or authoritie, it can clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently be <hi>demonſtrated</hi> by any <hi>inuincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> to which no <hi>probable anſwere</hi> can be giuen, that this ſufficient Paſtorall authoritie to gouerne the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body of Chriſt doth by his inſtitution extend to depoſing, killing or inflicting temporall puniſhments by way of correction, but onely to Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall cenſures, which are more agreeable to the nature, qualitie and condition of a ſpirituall common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And this I did probably proue in my Apologie two manner of waies, firſt poſitiuely by alleaging certaine <hi>probable reaſons and authorities,</hi> which might ſufficiently perſwade any man to thinke this opinion to be <hi>probable,</hi> and then <hi>negatiuely</hi> by alleaging <hi>probable anſweres</hi> to all the arguments, which Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> brought to proue the contrarie. Neither hath D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> howſoeuer to the world he would ſeeme to make a ſhew, ſo <hi>inuincibly</hi> impugned either my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or anſweres, but that as yet they remaine <hi>probable,</hi> as heereafter, God willing, I will ſufficiently make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. By this thou maieſt perceiue <hi>(courteous Reader)</hi> that albeit our Aduerſaries doe cry out againſt vs, that we denying this authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe contradict the words of our Sauiour, <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi> yet in very deed we embrace the holy Scriptures, as alſo the Sacred Councels and Doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church with as much reuerence, ſpeaking with all dutifull reſpect, as they doe, but we onely contradict
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:489:182"/>
as forthwith thou ſhalt better vnderſtand, the <hi>vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inferences and collections,</hi> which they out of holy Scripture endeauour to conclude.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Firſt therefore in my Apologie<note n="x" place="margin">Num. 239. &amp; ſeq.</note> 
                     <hi>I anſwered,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> by thoſe words <hi>[Feed my ſheepe]</hi> gaue to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his ſucceſſours all ſufficient Paſtorall authoritie to feede, correct and puniſh his ſheepe, and to gouerne the Church which hee inſtituted a ſpirituall and not a temporal Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth. But conſidering that neither by theſe words, <hi>feed my ſheep,</hi> nor by any words of holy Scripture, our Sauiour Chriſt did in expreſſe tearmes extend this Paſtorall authoritie of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to puniſh with temporall puniſhments, which doe belong to a temporal Common-wealth, he did in the very inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of the Church, which he made a ſpirituall, and not a temporall common-wealth, and in the appointing of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be a ſpirituall and not a temporall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour or gouernour thereof, limit his ſpirituall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpirituall cenſures and puniſhments, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature, qualitie and condition of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall common-wealth. Neither is that true which <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> affirmeth in the end of his argument, <hi>that euery Sheepheard hath power to correct his ſheepe, not according to any determinate manner in generall, but as it ſhall be conuenient or expedient for the ſheepe.</hi> For inferiour or vnder Sheepheards haue no more authoritie, then it pleaſeth the chiefe Sheepheard to grant vnto them, as reaſon and experience doe plainly ſhew. And by this aſſertion of <hi>Suarez,</hi> it would follow that Kings and Princes, who are appointed by God to be Sheepheards of men in temporall cauſes, had power to correct their ſheepe with ſpirituall puniſhments, <hi>if according to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate manner in generall their power to puniſh were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited:</hi> and ſo <hi>Suarez</hi> bringeth a prettie argument to proue the ſpirituall ſupremacie of all Chriſtian Kings ouer their chriſtian Subiects.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There bee therefore two kinds of <hi>Sheepheards,</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:489:182"/>
which doe gouerne vnreaſonable ſheepe, as I obſerued in that place, the one who are meere <hi>Sheepheards</hi> and not <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>owners</hi> of the ſheepe, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> who fed his <hi>father</hi> in law <hi>Labans</hi> ſheepe<note n="y" place="margin">Geneſ. ca. 29.</note>, the other who bee both <hi>Sheepheards</hi> and alſo Lords of the ſheepe they feede, as was <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi> Betwixt theſe two <hi>Sheepheards</hi> there is this difference,<note place="margin">2. Gec. 13.</note> that the ſecond kind of <hi>Shepeheards</hi> haue an abſolute and vnlimited power ouer their ſheepe, that if either they goe aſtray, or bee ſcabbed, or any way troubleſome to the flocke, they may either pin them vp, or if they will, puniſh them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, or alſo kill them, but this vnlimited power to puniſh the ſheepe, theſe <hi>Sheepheards</hi> haue not meerely as they are <hi>Sheepheards,</hi> but as the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>owners</hi> of the ſheepe. But the ſecond kinde of <hi>Sheepheards</hi> haue indeed authoritie giuen them to feede and gouerne the ſheepe, but not in ſo abſolute and ample a manner as the others haue. For it is their office to feede the ſheepe and to keepe them in good order, and conſequently to prouide them good and wholeſome paſture, if they goe aſtray, to recall them with their voice, with their ſtaffe, with their dogges; if they be infected with the ſcabbe, or haue taken any other contagious diſeaſe, to ſhut them vp and ſeuer them from the reſt, to cure them as conueniently as they may; and laſtly to defend them from wolues, and all other deuouring beaſts. But to kill the ſheepe, if they offend, or any other way to puniſh them for any fault paſt, as it is paſt, they cannot without the <hi>owners</hi> leaue. Now when the <hi>Pope</hi> is reſembled to a <hi>Sheepheard</hi> of vnreaſonable ſheepe, this compariſon, for as much as concerneth the killing of his ſheepe, or otherwiſe puniſhing them with temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, is to be applyed to the firſt kinde of <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the ſame place I did obſerue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vnreaſonable, and reaſonable ſheepe there is this difference, that vnreaſonable ſheepe haue no weapons whereby they may defend themſelues from rauening wolues, nor any outward remedy to cure themſelues of any diſeaſe, but all their ſafety relyeth onely vpon the Shepheards care and induſtry, but Chriſtian ſoules, which are the ſheepe of the ſpirituall flocke of Chriſt, haue ſpirituall weapons, whereby they may fight and defend themſelues againſt all the aſſaults of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and they haue ſpirituall remedies to cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of all diſeaſes, yea they cannot bee wounded or diſeaſed vnleſſe they themſelues be willing thereunto. And from hence I gathered, that in a ſpirituall Paſtour, there is not neceſſary ſo great a power to gouerne his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:489:184"/>
ſheepe, onely for the ſaluation of their ſoules, which is the chiefe end of his authority, (ſeeing that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hurt vnleſſe they will, and if they will, they may cure themſelues with ſpirituall medicines which God hath appointed in his Church,) as is neceſſary in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sheepheard to gouerne vnreaſonable ſheepe, whoſe ſafety doth chiefly, and almoſt onely depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his care and diligence. And this diſtinction betwixt an ordinary <hi>Sheepheard</hi> of ſheepe, and of ſoules, Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> doth well obſerue.<note n="f" place="margin">Lib. 2. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotio an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te medium.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not lawfull,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to cure men with ſo great an authority, as a Sheepheard doth cure his ſheepe.

                  <p n="9">9 And afterwards hee declareth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Secular Magiſtrate, and a Paſtor of ſoules: <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Iudges</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when they doe finde wicked men to haue offended againſt the Lawes, doe ſhew themſelues to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great authority and power, and doe constraine the ſame offenders, yea although they bee vnwilling, to change their manners; but heere thou muſt onely counſell not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, and by this way make him better whom thou takest vpon thee to correct, for there is not ſo great a power giuen to vs by the lawes to conſtraine ſinners.</hi> And this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> betwixt a Sheepheard of vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and reaſonable ſheepe, and betwixt a Biſhop and a Secular Magiſtrate, alſo Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue.

And likewiſe I ſay of the Secular power. For a Secular Iudge is exerciſed about outward actions, and therefore he can conſtraine a man, although he be vnwilling, to change his manners, to wit, outward, but a Biſhop is exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:489:184"/>
inward manners, which cannot bee changed against the will of him who hath them. For although a Biſhop can excommunicate, and inflict other puniſhments,</hi>

And therefore from hence wee may well conclude againſt the laſt part of <hi>Suarez</hi> argument, that a ſpirituall Paſtor hath power to correct his ſheepe in that manner, as ſhall be conuenient, and expedient for the ſheepe, but yet determined, and limited to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, quality, and condition of a ſpiritual flock, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is appointed by Chriſt to be a ſpirituall, and not a temporall Paſtor.</p>

power as it is directiue,</hi> or commanding, <hi>is not determined to this, or that manner of direction,</hi> or commanding, <hi>which bindeth in this or that manner by a perſonall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or a permanent law, but doth comprehend all conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient direction, therefore the ſame is to bee vnderſtood of the coerciue,</hi> or chaſtiſing <hi>power.</hi> We anſwere <hi>firſt,</hi> that as the commanding power of the Church is not limited to a perſonall, or permanent command; ſo alſo the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciue power to puniſh is not limited to a perſonall, or permanent coercion or puniſhment, for, as daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth, the <hi>Pope</hi> may either as it were perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inflict an Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, or which ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for euer, and be permanent as a Law; and in this manner the ſimilitude betwixt the not limiting of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and chaſtiſing is good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Secondly,</hi> if that aſſertion of <hi>Suarez</hi> bee ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that as the Eccleſiaſticall, or ſpirituall power to commaund is not limited to any certaine manner of commanding, ſo that it be conuenient, and beſeeming the nature and condition of an Eccleſiaſticall or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body, or ſociety, ſo alſo the Eccleſiaſticall power of puniſhing is not limited to any certaine manner of puniſhing ſo that it bee conuenient and beſeeming the nature and condition of an Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall body, or Society, wee alſo grant his compariſon. But then we affirme, that as temporal coertion or puniſhing is onely conuenient, and proper to a temporall body or Society, ſo alſo onely ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſtical puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or cenſures are conuenient and beſeeming a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, or Eccleſiaſticall body or ſociety, as out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Catholike Authors we haue ſhewed but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Wherfore there is a great difference to be obſerued betwixt the power to command, and to puniſh. For the Eccleſiaſticall power to command is as it were vnlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and may be extended to all things both ſpirituall, and alſo temporall, but not as they are temporal, but as
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:489:186"/>
in regard of the vertue or ſinne therein contained they become ſpirituall: becauſe the obiect of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call directiue or commanding power is vertue, or vice, which may bee found in all things whatſoeuer as well temporall as ſpirituall: and ſo the Eccleſiaſticall power forbidding a temporall thing as it is a ſinne, doth not doe any thing, which is not beſeeming the nature and condition of a ſpirituall body or Society, but the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one of temporall lands, goods, liberty, or life are alwaies temporall puniſhments for what crime ſoeuer, either ſpirituall or temporall they be inflictd, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not conuenient or beſeeming the nature and condition of a ſpirituall common-wealth, as I haue ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 And this diſtinction betwixt the commanding &amp; chaſtiſing power doth euidently appeare in the Ciuill Common-wealth, which hauing for the obiect of her directiue or commanding power publike peace, and publike diſquietnes, as the Eccleſiaſtical hath vertue &amp; vice, may forbid al things euen Eccleſiaſtical matters as they are truly manifeſt wrongs to the Ciuil ſociety, and vniuſt hinderances to the publike peace, for that theſe vniuſt oppreſſions although principally and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are ſpirituall, yet ſecondarily and by accident they are temporall wrongs, and in that regard may bee puniſhed by the Ciuill Magiſtrate, not with ſpirituall, but with temporall puniſhments, as before in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation<note n="o" place="margin">cap. 7. ſec. 2. nu. 17.</note> I haue ſhewed out of thoſe two moſt famous Dominicks, <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Bannes,</hi> both of them moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned profeſſours in Diuinity in the Vniuerſity of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and both of them Religious men of the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned order of S. <hi>Dominicke.</hi> Whereby we may perceiue that this manner of arguing, which <hi>Suarez</hi> vſeth in comparing the directiue power with the correctiue is not allowable, for otherwiſe wee might in like manner conclude, that as the Ciuill power to command is not ſo limited, but that it may ſometimes bee extended to

Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall matters, ſo alſo the ciuill power to puniſh is not ſo limited, but that it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be extended to puniſh with Eccleſiaſtical and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall puniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Now concerning that which <hi>Suarez</hi> in the end of this argument affirmeth, that <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the fourth <hi>with the Councell of Lyons</hi> did out of this text gather the Popes power to depoſe Princes, we haue alſo anſwered heretofore<note n="p" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie nu. 251. &amp;c.</note>; <hi>firſt,</hi> that the depoſing of <hi>Frederike</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was not done by the Councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi> but in the Councell, or rather in the preſence of the Councell, but without the Councels conſent: which we probably deduced from the very title of the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> wherein <hi>Frederike</hi> was depoſed; which is this: <hi>Innocentius Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Seruant of Seruants, &amp;c. the ſacred Councell being preſent to the perpetuall memorie heereof.</hi> And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth the Bull, wherein this text of Scripture <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe &amp;c.</hi> is alleaged.

                     <hi>was wearie of his life, and wiſhed that he had neuer thought of depoſing him,</hi> if the whole Councell had approued that depoſition, he would not only haue ſaid, <hi>The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Councell being preſent,</hi> but, <hi>the Sacred Councell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing,</hi> as in all other decrees when the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell decreeth any thing it is vſually ſaid, eſpecially ſeeing that immediatly after in the very next decree this latter manner of ſpeech is vſed, which argueth a greate diuerſitie in the making of theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:489:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that this anſwere which I haue giuen is not <hi>probable,</hi> for I will not deny, but hee may bring <hi>probable</hi> reaſons to proue that the aforeſaid depoſing of <hi>Frederike</hi> was done by the conſent of the whole Councell, but that is not ſufficient, we expect from him <hi>euident demonſtrations,</hi> otherwiſe he will neuer proue his opinion to be certain. I added alſo another coniecture, which was, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſentence of depoſition was denounced not without aſtoniſhment of al the hearers and ſtanders by, as it is related in the Councels, but there was not ſuch great cauſe why all the Fathers of the Councell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſentence ſhould be aſtoniſhed, if before they had giuen their aſſent thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Secondly,</hi> how farre the reaſons not only of Popes, but alſo of generall Councels, which they alleadge for any decree can binde, wee haue ſhewed before in this Diſputation<note n="r" place="margin">Cap. 6. ſec. 3. nu. 23.</note>. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if wee ſhould grant to <hi>Suarez,</hi> that not only the <hi>Pope</hi> but alſo the Councell did hold it as a farre more probable opinion that the Church hath power to depoſe Princes, and thereupon did proceede in giuing that ſentence, but that they did not hold it as a matter of faith, <hi>Suarez</hi> wil neuer be able in my iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with <hi>inuincible arguments to demonſtrate</hi> the contrarie.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:489:188"/>
that thereby the Chriſtians, and Chriſtian faith might be had in greater reuerence.

Wherefore ſeeing that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not the Church, but a principall member thereof, there is to be made a great diſtinction betweene the facts and practiſe of <hi>Popes,</hi> and betweene the facts and practiſe of the Church, neither is the practiſe of many <hi>Popes</hi> to bee accounted the practiſe of the Church, vnleſſe by the whole Church it bee receiued, as that opinion of the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, and to inflict temporall puniſhments <hi>by way of coercion</hi> neuer was, and therefore that argument which <hi>Suarez,</hi> ſaith, is drawen from the practiſe of the Church, conſidering that this practiſe was neuer approued by the whole Church, is of litle worth, and may rather be brought to ſcarre ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then to perſwade any prudent or learned man.

Succeſſours, whom he hath appointed to bee the ſupreame head, and Paſtour of the Church, all authoritie which is neceſſary to the gouerning of his flocke, but authoritie to depoſe Princes is neceſſary for the gouernement of the Church, therefore Chriſt hath giuen authoritie to S.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Succeſſours to depoſe Princes.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not in expreſſe words ſet downe by <hi>Suarez;</hi> but it is ſuppoſed; for he onely declareth the <hi>Minor</hi> for what cauſe, or by what title this authoritie is neceſſary.

By reaſon of the first title this authoritie is neceſſary, that the</hi> Pope <hi>may either correct, or amend a rebellious Prince, or alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him according to his deſerts; for both of theſe doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to a Paſtour: but oftentimes it falleth out, that onely Cenſures are not ſufficient to thoſe effects, and daily experience doth ſufficiently ſhew, therefore of neceſſitie we muſt alſo affirme, that Christ hath giuen this power to his Vicar, conſidering that he hath appointed him to be his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, as well of Chriſtian Princes, as of the reſt of the people.</hi>

                     <hi>becauſe the Church hath power ouer other faithfull perſons, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians baptiſed not onely to correct them by Cenſures, that they may amend their fault, but alſo to puniſh the offences committed by other temporall or corporall puniſhments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner, which is agreeable to an Eccleſiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iudge and Paſtour, therefore the lawfull Prelats of the Church, and eſpecially the Pope hath the ſame power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer ſupreame temporall Princes,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Antecedent propoſition is manifeſt by the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall practiſe of the Church. For the Canons doe vſually impoſe a pecuniarie mulct ſometimes to confiſcation of goods: now and then alſo they doe impoſe corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:489:191"/>
without danger of loſing life or member, as is whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and ſometimes ſending to the Gallies, and when a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhment is neceſſarie, although Eccleſiaſticall Iudges for decencie of their Order are not wont to giue ſentence thereof, yet they may commit the perſon offending to the Secular Iudge, commanding him to puniſh the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender according to the equitie of the lawes.

to the politike end, and to the peace of the Common-wealth, and to humane iuſtice, but to puniſh them as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Religion and the health of ſoules, doth of it ſelfe belong to the ſpirituall power, and therefore to her chiefly ought to appertaine power to vſe temporall puniſhments for ſuch correction, either by inflicting them by her ſelfe, or by vſing the help of the Secular Magiſtrate, that all things may be done decently, orderly, and effectually.</hi>

As for example the power of the Sunne to giue light may be vnderſtood to be ſufficient either in regard of the power it ſelfe to enlighten, or in regard alſo of thoſe things which are otherwiſe neceſſarie for the Sunne to giue light, and which if they be not preſent will hinder the Sunne from giuing light. And although the Sunne hath not ſufficient power to take away all thoſe things, which can hinder it from giuing light, for ſo it ſhould haue power to draw the body which it hath power to enlighten towards it, that the body may be in a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance, and alſo to make it perſpicuous &amp; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of light, Which neuertheleſſe to effect are not in the power of the Sunne, and yet there is no man who will therefore deny, that the Sunne hath all neceſſarie, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,

                  <p n="6">6 Wherefore as before in this diſputation<note n="q" place="margin">Cap. 6. ſec. 2. nu. 6.</note> I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Gretzers</hi> argument, that to diſpenſe in an Oath, or vow two things are required, the one a power to diſpenſe, the other a iuſt and ſufficient cauſe or title for which he may vſe that power to diſpenſe, and without which that power to diſpenſe ſhall worke no effect at all, yet that iuſt cauſe or title doth not giue the <hi>Pope</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to diſpenſe, but doth ſuppoſe authority to bee giuen him, and therefore from a iuſt cauſe, or title to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:489:195"/>
diſpenſe in a vow we cannot rightly inferre a true au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to diſpenſe. In like manner wee anſwere now, that thoſe two titles, which <hi>Suarez</hi> alleageth, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſufficient cauſes, which may iuſtly moue the <hi>Pope</hi> to chaſtiſe Princes with temporall puniſhments, if hee had authority to puniſh them in that kind, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which cauſes, or the like, although hee had ſuch an authority to puniſh them, yet the exerciſing thereof would bee vniuſt, neuertheleſſe theſe cauſes doe not proue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath ſuch a temporall power to puniſh, but by other waies it muſt bee prooued, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath giuen to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſours ſuch a temporall power, which hath not hitherto beene ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conuinced by Scriptures, or any other proofe. It appertaineth indeed to a Paſtour to puniſh, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the authority as is committed to him by the cheefe and ſupreame Paſtor of all. Now whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath giuen to the <hi>Pope</hi> all that temporall authority to puniſh Princes in order to the ſpiritual good, which he hath giuen to Princes to puniſh their ſubiects in order to the temporal good, is the very thing which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie: And therefore <hi>Suarez</hi> vnleſſe hee will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that fault in arguing which the Logicians call <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio principij,</hi> which is to take that for proued, which he is to prooue, muſt not ſuppoſe that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to correct &amp; puniſh temporall Princes, not only with ſpirituall puniſhments which are proper to a ſpirituall common-wealth, but alſo with temporal, which ſeeme onely to belong to a temporall common-wealth, but he muſt alſo proue the ſame with <hi>inuincible arguments, and</hi> and not onely to bring certaine cauſes, and ſufficient titles for which the <hi>Pope</hi> may iuſtly put in execution ſuch an authority if he had it.</p>

                  <p n="7">7 Therfore this is not a good argument: The faithfull Corinthians might, &amp; alſo ought, according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> admonition, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auoiding of ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dal, appoint <hi>ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues</hi> certaine <hi>Arbitrarie Iudges</hi> to decide thoſe cauſes, for which they were not bound to go to the tribunals of the Gentiles, therfore they might in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner appoint <hi>ouer themſelues</hi> new Kings, &amp; Princes.

                  <p n="8">8 In like manner both I<note n="n" place="margin">In my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie in 288. &amp; ſeq.</note>, and the two <hi>Barclaies</hi>

                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:489:201"/>
haue fully anſwered to the firſt part of that argument, which <hi>Suarez</hi> bringeth in the laſt place, to wit, <hi>that a faithfull wife may be ſeparated from her husband, who is an infidell, if ſhee cannot dwell with him without iniurie to the Creatour; and children baptized are freed from the power, and companie of their parents who are infidels, leſt that they ſhould againe be intangled with their errors, therefore by the like, or with greater reaſon, a Chriſtian King may by reaſon of Baptiſme be depriued of his power, and Dominion ouer his vaſſals.</hi> For we made very apparant the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of this conſequence by ſhewing the great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie betwixt theſe two ſeparations. And firſt the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betwixt the infidell husband and the wife, who is become a Chriſtian, is not diſſolued by the <hi>Popes</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but by God himſelfe, permitting, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the ſame, as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Li. 1. de adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gijs cap 19.</note> expreſly affirmeth, and therefore this ſimilitude proueth nothing for the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depoſe, but rather that the faithfull Subiects may depoſe their Prince who is an infidell, if they can not liue vnder his ſubiection without iniurie to the Creatour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Secondly,</hi> if we ſpeake of the depoſing of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes,</hi> for whom principally, or rather againſt whom he handleth this queſtion, this ſimilitude is flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe. For a wife baptized cannot depart from her husband who alſo is baptized, and diſſolue the bond of matrimonie, although he ſhould become an heretike or infidell, and that ſhee can not liue with him without iniurie to the Creatour; therefore neither Subiects bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized can depart from the obedience of their Prince who is baptized, and by depoſing him diſſolue the bond of their allegiance, although he ſhould become an heretike or infidell, and that they cannot liue with him without iniurie to the Creatour.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is a great diſparitie in this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for that a wife to leaue her husband argueth no authoritie to be in the wife ouer her husband, but for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:489:201"/>
the people to depoſe their Prince argueth a ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Superioritie to be in the people ouer their Soueraign Prince, which ſupreme authoritie cannot be in the people, who are ſubiect vnto him. The moſt that this compariſon can proue is, that as a faithful wife, who cannot liue with her husband without offending her Creatour, may leaue his companie, but not diſſolue the bond of matrimonie, and marry an other husband, ſo a Chriſtian Subiect, if he cannot without offending God liue with the <hi>Prince</hi> in his Kingdome, hee may depart the Land, becauſe this argueth no authoritie to bee in the Subiect ouer his Prince, but only a meere right to keepe himſelfe from ſinne, but hee cannot depoſe his Prince, and diſſolue the naturall bond of his Allegiance for the cauſe aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Laſtly Maſter <hi>Iohn Barclay</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">§. 20.</note> doth well obſerue, <hi>that when Saint</hi> Paul <hi>gaue this admonition to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Chriſtian wiues were by the bond of marriage ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to infidell husbands, ſo alſo ſome Chriſtian men were by the bond of allegiance, and obedience ſubiect to infidell Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; Lords, yea al Chriſtians were at that time ſubiect to infidell Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the Apoſtle in no place in no caſe did graunt the people leaue to reuolt from their Prince, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants from their Lord. And why ſhould not the Apoſtle haue admoniſhed faithful Subiects of their dutie as well as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiues? for what cauſe ſhould hee haue intangled their conſciences? He teacheth that the bond of matrimonie ought to be firme, and yet that in infidels it may be diſſolued, if one of them embrace the faith of Chriſt: He teacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that Subiects, and ſeruants ought to obey their Prince, and Lords or Maſters for conſcience ſake, neither maketh he any exception of an infidell Prince or Lord (as he did of Matrimonie) yea manifeſtly excludeth all exception, ſeeing that he then ſpake expreſly of infidell Princes, and of infidell Lords or Maſters: therefore according to this doctrine it is not lawfull for faithfull people to caſt off the ſubiection which they owe to an infidell Prince.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:489:202"/>10. To the ſecond part of the argument I anſwere in like manner, that Children baptized are freed from the power and company of their Parents who are Iewes or infidels, not by the authoritie of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but either by the authoritie of Chriſt, as chriſtian wiues are from their husbands, who are infidels, or elſe by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ciuill Magiſtrate, to whom thoſe infidell Parents are ſubiect in ciuill matters. For wee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue two obligations, wherein children are bound to their parents, the one naturall and diuine, which doth conſiſt in this that children muſt honour and reuerence their parents, as thoſe from whom next vnder God, they haue receiued life and being, and this bond no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power can releaſe, the other ciuill, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the ciuill law, and which bond, according to the cuſtomes and lawes of diuers nations, is more or leſſe ſtrict: as that children are bound to liue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of their parents, and vnder their potection or gard, that they cannot marry or make any contrict without the conſent of their parents, and ſuch like; and this bond as it was made by the ciuill law, ſo it may, and oftentimes is by the ſame law in diuers caſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Wherefore if that fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which <hi>Suarez</hi> alleageth, did onely declare that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized children of Iewes, were by the law of God freed from the power and company of their parents, which forbiddeth all probable danger of falling into ſinne, this Councell maketh nothing to proue the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to free either children or Subiects baptized from the power of their parents, or Princes, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels: but if <hi>Suarez</hi> will affirme that the Councell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted baptized children of infidell parents from all ciuill ſubiection due to parents by the ciuill law, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that it maketh alſo little to proue that Clergie men, <hi>as Clergie men,</hi> haue power to abſolue children from ciuill ſubiection, for that this decree was made by the conſent of the temporall Prince, King <hi>Siſennand,</hi> as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:489:202"/>
appeareth both by the firſt words of the Councell, and many other decrees, eſpecially concerning Iewes, as in the 64. Canon beginneth, <hi>Our moſt excellent Lord and King Siſennand commanding, the ſacred Councell ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, &amp;c.</hi> and the 65. By the decree of the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, &amp;c. and in the very next Canon before that which <hi>Suarez</hi> citeth, the Councell ſpeaking of the Iewes decreeth thus, <hi>Concerning whom</hi> (to wit, the Iewes) <hi>this Sacred Councell, by the aduice of our most pious and most Religious Lord King</hi> Siſennand <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Wherefore there is the ſame diſparitie in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude which is in the former, for that children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to bee freed from the power of their infidell pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, argueth no authoritie to bee in the children ouer their parents, but only a right to keepe themſelues from ſinne, but for Subiects to depoſe their Prince, argueth a ſupreame authoritie and ſuperioritie to be in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ouer their Prince. Therfore neither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> farre greater reaſon, nor with the like reaſon, or ſcarſe with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all doth <hi>Suarez</hi> conuince by the aforeſaid ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Princes. And neuertheleſſe wee doe freely acknowledge that the ſword muſt be vnder the ſword, and that they muſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually helpe on the other to defend the Church; but this ſubiection of the temporall ſword to the ſpirituall, and of the ciuill power to the Eccleſiaſticall, wee doe not vnderſtand in that manner, as <hi>Suarez</hi> doth, but as we before<note n="ſ" place="margin">Cap. 3. ſec. 1. nu. 13.</note> declared in this Diſputation in anſwering to <hi>Suarez</hi> argument.</p>

And Chriſt, if it had pleaſed him, might haue giuen to the <hi>Pope</hi> ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall authoritie, that whenſoeuer he ſhould excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any wicked Prince, he ſhould either preſently be miraculouſly ſlaine, as <hi>Ananias</hi> was at the voice of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Diuel ſhould incontinently torment him with corporall afflictions, as the fornicatour was by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they doe alſo conuince, that the <hi>Pope</hi>

hath power not onely to depriue Princes of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but alſo of their liues: For according to <hi>Suarez</hi> thoſe words of our Sauiour, <hi>Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>Feed my ſheepe,</hi> are generall, nor limited to this or that kind of puniſhment, and therefore they ought not, ſaith <hi>Suarez,</hi> to bee limited by vs, but are to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all puniſhments, which the <hi>Pope</hi> in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion ſhall thinke conuenient. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe Doctor <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> or rather Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> as moſt men ſay, whom by force of argument I greatly vrged to declare his opinion in this point, doth neuer in ſuch plaine and perſpicuous words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame, (although in ſome places, eſpecially pag. 413. 488. &amp; 489. it may eaſily bee gathered) but that he may alwaios haue ſome ſort of euaſion. And therefore whereas I in my <hi>Apologie</hi> did oftentimes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> arguments vrge this obiection, and did apparantly conuince, that thoſe who defend the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depoſe Princes, muſt of neceſſity according to their grounds alſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> for the ſpiritual good of ſoules hath alſo authoritie to kill Kings by all thoſe waies ſecrete or publike, by which a temporal <hi>Prince</hi> for the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall good of the Common-wealth hath authoritie to kill any of his Subiects, for that, according to this doctrine of depoſing, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath abſolutely as ample autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer <hi>Princes</hi> in order to ſpirituall good, as <hi>Princes</hi> haue ouer their ſubiects for the temporall good: yet for all this he doth neuer anſwere directly to this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather demonſtration, but ſtill runneth to that ſaying of S. <hi>Leo, Eccleſiaſtical leuitie doth auoid cruell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengings;</hi> Which either may be vnderſtood that Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men <hi>(as Cleargie)</hi> can not by the law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the ſpilling of blood, or onely by the law of the Church, wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to diſpenſe. Moreouer this <hi>Doctour</hi> doth euer ſeeke to diſgrace me, and to miſ-interprete my ſincere cogitations, affirming
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:489:204"/>
that by vrging this obiection, I onely intended to make the <hi>See Apoſtolike</hi> odious to Princes, whereas, God is my witneſſe, I neuer had or haue any ſuch intention, but my onely meaning is and euer was plainely and ſincerely to find out the truth, it is rather themſelues, who endeauour to make the <hi>See Apoſtolike</hi> odious and dreadfull to Princes, by broching ſuch a ſcandalous and deſperate doctrine, and wee ſeeke rather to take away ſuch dreadfull iealouſies out of the mindes of Princes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>Suarez</hi> perceiuing the neceſſary conſequence of this argument doth deale more ſincerely, and doth in expreſſe words affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depriue Princes of their liues, and to giue leaue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to kill them. For thus he writeth, ſpeaking of the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depoſe<note n="r" place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 4. nu. 18.</note>, <hi>after a condemnatorie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen by lawfull authoritie, whereby a King is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his kingdome, or which is all one, after a declaratory ſentence of the crime, which hath ſuch a puniſhment impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon it by the law it ſelfe, he who gaue the ſentence, or to whom he will giue commiſſion, may depriue the King of his kingdome, alſo by killing him, if otherwiſe hee cannot, or if the iuſt ſentence doth alſo extend to this puniſhment.</hi> And a little beneath he writeth thus: <hi>And in the ſame manner, if the Pope depoſe a King, he can be put out or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onely by them, to whom he ſhall giue commiſſion. But if he command the execution to no man, it ſhall belong to the lawfull ſucceſſour in the kingdome, or if there be none to be found,</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">Nu. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>to the kingdome it ſelfe:</hi> and a little after he ſaith, that <hi>this doctrine is true and certaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Neuertheleſſe this doctrine of <hi>Suarez</hi> is in my opinion not onely vncertaine, but it is alſo a new and very ſcandalous doctrine. That it is vncertaine, it may appeare by that which hath beene ſaid before, for if the doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes, and to inflict temporall puniſhments, <hi>by way of coercion,</hi> bee vncertaine, in ſo much that <hi>very many Doctors</hi> doe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:489:204"/>
hold, as <hi>Gerſon and Almaine</hi> doe affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> his inſtitution hath not authority ſo much as to impriſon, much more it is vncertaine that hee hath power to kill, and puniſh by ſhedding of bloud, which <hi>Eccleſiaſticall lenity doth ſo much abhorre.</hi> That it is a new doctrine it is manifeſt, for that before theſe latter yeares it was neuer taught in the Church of God, and now there is ſcarce one or two who dare in expreſſe words auouch the ſame; And whether it bee a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous doctrine or no that if a Prince bee depoſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> the next ſucceſſour hath authority to kill him, if he cannot depoſe him, and conſequently that the next ſucceſſour may giue leaue to any priuate man to kil that Prince who is by the <hi>Pope</hi> depoſed, I leaue it to the iudgement of the diſcreet Reader. Beſides if the <hi>Pope</hi> can giue leaue to any man to kill a Prince after hee bee depoſed, as <hi>Suarez</hi> affirmeth, I doe not ſee but that hee may alſo according to his grounds giue ſecret licence to any man ſecretly to kill him, before he be depoſed, if he ſhall thinke his ſentence of depoſition wil little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail with him, but rather be a cauſe to hinder his killing for that ſuch a Prince will be more carefull thereby to preuent all future trecheries; For it is not neceſſary that the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt vnking him before he hath power to kill him, for that according to <hi>Suarez</hi> doctrine a Chriſtian King remaining a King is ſubiect to the <hi>Popes</hi> power of correcting and puniſhing, and it is left to his diſcretion what puniſhment hee will inflict vpon him, for that Chriſt hath not limited his coerciue power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither ought it to bee limited by vs or by any Chriſtian Prince.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Moreouer I cannot perceiue but that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine giueth way to priuate men to murther Kings, not onely with the <hi>Popes</hi> expreſſe licence, but alſo with his vertuall leaue, and with preſumption, that either hee will not or ought not to bee vnwilling. Which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence although <hi>Suarez</hi> doth denye; <hi>for that,</hi> ſaith he<note n="t" place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 4. nu. 19.</note>,

                     <note n="t" place="margin">Lib. 6. ca. 4. nu. 19.</note>
                     <hi>a Iudge condemning a priuate hereticke or malefactour doth not preſently giue leaue to all men to kill him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the Pope condemning an hereticall, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tyrannicall King doth vertually and couertly giue ſuch a licence. For there can bee no iuſt cauſe alleaged why this licence ſhould be preſumed rather againſt a Prince then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others. For prudence, and a iuſt manner in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution it ſelfe is alwaies neceſſary, and there is greater danger of diſturbance, and exceſſe in puniſhing a kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 But this reaſon of <hi>Suarez</hi> although it may ſtand, if we ſpeake of the killing of a King, as the killing of him is a puniſhment, yet it is not ſo ſufficient, if wee ſpeake of the killing of a King, as the killing of him is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of many innocent ſoules from danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Suarez</hi> doth hold, as wee haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depriue Kings of their kingdomes, and conſequently of their liues by reaſon of two titles, the one is in regard of the King himſelfe to amend him, or puniſh him, the other in regard of the Subiects to defend them from being oppreſſed, which alſo may bee applied to a Subiect who is a common robber by the high waies, and condemned to death, who although hee cannot bee killed by any man to whom the Magiſtrate hath not granted particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as his killing is a puniſhment of his offence, yet as his killing is a defence of ſo many innocent men, it may probably be preſumed that the Magiſtrate giueth vertuall licence to any man to kill him, if hee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and cannot bee apprehended, but continueth ſtill in robbing. In like manner conſidering the killing of a <hi>King</hi> may probably be the ſafety of ſo many ſoules, why may it not with great reaſon be preſumed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Suarez</hi> doctrine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is willing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if without great diſturbance or other blood-ſhed it can priuately be done? Nay why may it not with great reaſon bee preſumed that the <hi>Pope</hi> is bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:489:205"/>
to be willing, and to giue expreſſe leaue, yea and to command priuate men, if they can commodiouſly kill ſuch a King, whereby a whole kingdome may be free from his Tyranny, ſeeing that euery priuate man is bound to prefer the common good and ſaluation of ſo many thouſand ſoules, although it bee with imminent danger of his owne life? Now whether theſe collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are probably deduced from the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Suarez</hi> be ſcandalous, I thinke that there is no prudent man but will acknowledge. And whether all Kings haue not great reaſon to oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a new, and deſperate doctrine, whereby there liues are ſubiect to the indiſcreet zeale of euery priuate man, who may probably pretend that the <hi>Popes Holineſſe</hi> either is or ought to be willing thereunto, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the iudgement of any ſenſible man.

Secondly, the meaning of that propoſition may be, that to treat of that power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which is probably iudged not to be a ſpiritual power of the <hi>Pope</hi> but a temporall power of a King, and to propound it to be ſworn as probable, ſo long as it remaineth probable, doth not appertaine to the temporall power of a King; and in this ſenſe his propoſition is vntrue; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould not appertaine to the ciuill power to treat of any authority which the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould chalenge ouer temporall Kings, or which ſome few Catholikes againſt the common opinion of others, ſhould giue &amp; attribute to the <hi>Pope:</hi> &amp; conſequently a temporall King could not cauſe his Subiects to acknowledge by Oath, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not King of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Chriſtian world, &amp; that he hath not a direct power &amp; dominion in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals ouer his Kingdom, which power neuertheles Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth vehemently impugne as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of man, and a vſurpation of ciuill power.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Neither doth a temporall King, when he treateth of the <hi>Popes</hi> power, which is probably thought not to belong to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to temporal Princes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth cauſe his Subiects to acknowledge by oath that it doth belong to him, and not to the <hi>Pope,</hi> (which conſidering that it is probable they may lawfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) treat of the <hi>Popes</hi> power as it is accounted a ſpirituall power, &amp; therefore belonging to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but as it is probably accounted a temporall power, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belonging to the King. For a temporall <hi>King</hi> may by temporall right treate, diſpute, and maintaine that authoritie, which probably is thought to be a temporal, and not a ſpirituall authoritie. In like manner tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kings may forbid, and puniſh ſpirituall offences, not as they are ſpirituall but as they are temporall, wrongs, and diſturbances of the publike peace in a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:489:207"/>
ciuill Common-wealth: and ſo they may puniſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and periuries, which are euidently knowne to be ſuch not as they are ſpirituall, but as they are temporall iniuries, a I ſhewed before<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 7. ſec. 2. nu. 17.</note> out of <hi>Sotus,</hi> and <hi>Bannes.</hi> And for the ſame cauſe they may compel their Subiects by temporall puniſhments to abiure hereſies, which are cleerely knowne to be hereſies, if ſuch an abiuration vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prudent and probable motiues be thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the preſeruing of publike peace and quietneſſe in the Ciuill Common-wealth. But to define what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is hereticall, or to determine what authoritie is ſpirituall, and belonging to the Pope when it is called in queſtion, doth exceed the limits of temporall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill authority. I omit to examine at this preſent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ciuill authoritie of Chriſtian Kings may forbid and puniſh with temporal puniſhments ſpiritual crimes as they are ſpirituall, and hurtfull to the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are by God appointed to be Protectours, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their office is to defend the Church, to root out heretikes and ſchiſmatikes, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth acknowledge.

                     <hi>5</hi> Yea heere are<note n="i" place="margin">Nu. 7.</note> included new errours: one is that the Pope hath not power to releaſe Oaths, although a iust and reaſonable cauſe doth concurre, which is againſt the cuſtom of the Church, and againſt the practiſe and approbation of Generall Councells, <hi>cap. 2. de re iudicata in. 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſent of Catholike Doctors, and against the power to bind and looſe giuen to <hi>S.

For in like Oaths there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies included either a ſecret condition, if the promiſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed without notable hurt, and danger to the ſwearer, but eſpecially when that danger or hurt proceedeth through the wrong and violence of him, to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made; or elſe the right and power of the Superiour it vnderſtood to be reſerued, who can, notwithſtanding the promiſe made by the ſubiect, forbid him to performe that thing which he promiſed, if a iuſt and reaſonable cauſe doe occurre, and conſequently can releaſe the Oath by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matter. Laſtly this error ſuppoſeth the former. For if the Pope hath power to depoſe the King, of neceſſity he hath power to take away the bond of obedience and of the Oath, becauſe obedience is not promiſed to Iames, as hee is Iames, but as he is King, whereupon if hee ceaſe to be King, forthwith no obedience is due vnto him, and preſently the Oath doth not bind; for the matter of the Oath, beeing taken away, conſequently the obligation of the Oath muſt of neceſſity be taken away.</p>

                     <hi>6</hi> An other new errour is,<note n="k" place="margin">Nu. 8.</note> for that not onely the Popes power to depoſe an hereticall King is denied, but alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine his Subiects by ſuch like puniſhments, as appeareth

by thoſe words <hi>[or to any of his Maieſties Subiects]</hi> For the ſenſe of theſe words is not, that the Pope hath power to authorize at his pleaſure and without a reaſnable and iuſt cauſe compelling him thereunto, any forraine Prince to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade or annoy him or his Subiects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the meaning of thoſe words is, that the Pope hath not power to offer any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or hurt either to the King or to his Subiects, nor to giue licenſe to any other to doe any ſuch like thing against the Subiects of the King of England, although they be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postataes and Rebells to the Romane Church, and ſowers or fauourers of Schiſmes, and Hereſies, which is a great and new error, or doubtleſſe the ſame of the Kings Spurema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie explained.

                  <p n="8">8 Now concerning that new errour which <hi>Suarez</hi> affirmeth to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the later part of this branch, we affirme, that it is no errour but a probable doctrine of many Catholikes, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authority by Chriſt his inſtitution to depoſe Princes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neither to abſolue Subiects of their Allegiance either for a certaine time or for euer, either by vertue of Excommunication, or by ſentence of depriuation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that true, which <hi>Suarez</hi> doth ſo confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, that in the bond of <hi>Maior excommunication</hi> is <hi>intrinſecally</hi> included the diſcharging of Subiects of their Allegiance, as is manifeſt by the definition of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which he himſelfe aſſigneth,<note n="q" place="margin">Tom. 5. diſp. 8. ſec. 1.</note> which is this. <hi>Excommunication is an Eccleſiaſticall cenſure whereby one is depriued of the Eccleſiaſticall Communion of the faithfull;</hi> wherefore Excommunication according to <hi>Suarez</hi> owne definition doth <hi>intrinſecally</hi> and of it own nature only depriue one of Eccieſiaſtical participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of Sacraments and other holy rites, &amp; not of ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and much leſſe of temporal Allegiance, which Subiects by the Law of God do owe to their lawfull Prince. And this is cleerely ſignified by thoſe words of holy Scripture,<note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and if hee will not heare the Church, let him be to thee as the Heathen and the Publicane,</hi> for wee are not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Law of God to conuerſe ciuilly
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:489:216"/>
with Heathens or Publicanes, vnleſſe ſome ſpiritual danger, which by the Law of God and nature is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and which wee are bound to auoid, ſhould ariſe thereby. Neither did S. <hi>Paul</hi> when hee forbad to <hi>keepe company and to eat with a fornicator, a couetous perſon, a ſeruer of Idolls, a railer, a drunkard or extortioner,</hi> nor S. <hi>Iohn</hi> when he commanded, <hi>that wee ſhould not ſalute an heretike,</hi> as most Expoſitours doe interpret, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate thoſe perſons, but onely forbad that we ſhould not conuerſe with them, if our conuerſing with them were a ſcandall to the weake, an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to continue ſtill in their wickedneſſe, or a danger to be our ſelues peruerted by them, as S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> expoundeth that place: out of theſe three caſes the holy Scripture doth not forbid vs to conuerſe ciuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with notorious ſinners, yea although they bee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 But we muſt with all remember, that as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles commanded, that wee ſhould not conuerſe with notorious ſinners, leſt that we ſhould ſeem to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in their wicked deeds, ſo alſo they commanded ſeruants to obey their Maſters, children their parents, and ſubiects their temporall Princes, although they were wicked, yea and infidells, (for then there were no Chriſtian Kings at all.) Now I would gladly know of <hi>Suarez,</hi> whether if a maſter, father, or Prince bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, their ſeruants, children and ſubiects are by the Law of God forthwith diſcharged of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, obedience, and Allegiance which by the law of God they did owe to them: Certaine it is that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne doctrine, and according to that definition of Excommunication which out of him we did relate, they are not freed of that dutie wherein by the Law of God they ſtand bound to them as to their ſuperiours, and therefore he ſpeaketh very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly when he affirmeth, that diſcharging of Subiects of their Allegiance is <hi>intrinſecally</hi> included in Maior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:489:217"/>
It remaineth therefore that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Subiects of their Allegiance can onely for that cauſe bee ſaid to bee included any way in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication, for that the Church excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating a Prince doth thereby take away from that Prince his regall authority, and conſequently releaſe the Subiects of their ſubiection, for as before<note n="ſ" place="margin">Cap. 3. ſec. 5. nu. 3.</note> we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> alſo confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame, obedience and ſubiection is by the Law of God due to euery lawfull Prince. So that heere is no new error as <hi>Suarez</hi> affirmeth, but the ſame principall queſtion remaineth which was before, whether the Church hath authoritie to chaſtiſe Princes with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments; for if ſhe hath no ſuch authority, ſhe cannot by vertue of Excommunication inflict ſuch a temporall puniſhment, conſidering that by the Law of God no ſuch puniſhment is annexed to Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which beeing onely a ſpirituall cenſure cannot of it owne nature according to <hi>Suarez</hi> definition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue one of ciuill but onely of Eccleſiaſticall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: and this was the meaning of thoſe words of his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> whom <hi>Suarez</hi> hath not ſufficiently confuted. For when his <hi>Maiestie</hi> affirmed, that excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a ſpirituall cenſure, hee did not onely mean that it proceeded from a ſpirituall power, and tended to a ſpirituall end, but that it is by the Law of God and of it owne nature, as <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe defineth it, a meere ſpiritual cenſure or puniſhment onely depriuing one of the Eccleſiaſticall communion of the faithfull, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not extend to temporall puniſhments as it is inſtituted by our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 And if <hi>Suarez</hi> reply, that although by Chriſt his inſtitution Excommunication hath only this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall effect to depriue one of the Eccleſiaſticall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the faithfull, yet Chriſt hath left in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Church to annexe vnto Excommunication other temporall effects and puniſhments: We anſwere
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:489:217"/>
that this is very true, but with all that thoſe effects or puniſhments muſt be ſuch, which the Church hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to infict: but whether the Church hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to depoſe Princes and to inflict temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by way of coercion, is the maine queſtion which is now in hand: I ſay <hi>by the way of coercion,</hi> for no doubt the Church hath power to command cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine temporall things and ſo annexe them to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as not to eate, drinke, ſalute, nor to haue any ciuill conuerſation with excommunicated perſons out of thoſe caſes wherein by the law of God they are not bound ciuilly to conuerſe; and ſo the Church may command one to faſt, to giue almes and ſuch like, when it is neceſſarie for the ſaluation of ſoules, but if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the command of the Church we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with ſuch perſons, we do not faſt, we do not giue almes and ſuch like, what then can thy Church do? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Catholike Doctours, as I related before out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Almainus,</hi> doe probably thinke that her power doth not extend to inflict temporall puniſhments, no not ſo much as to impriſon, but that the laſt puniſhment which ſhee by Chriſt his inſtitution can inflict is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication or ſome ſuch like ſpirituall cenſure. I ſay, <hi>by Chriſt his inſtitution,</hi> for ſeeing that temporall Princes haue giuen to the Church either expreſly or vertually many temporall priuiledges, all thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which depend on theſe, ſhee may alſo annexe to excommunication. But to command Subiects not so obey their temporall Prince, and to abſolue them from that obedience which is due to temporall Princes by the law of God and Nature (for Regall authoritie in a Prince, and ciuill obedience in the Subiects are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatiues as <hi>Suarez</hi> before affirmed) the Church hath no authority, vnleſſe ſhee hath power to depoſe Kings and to make them no Kings, which whether ſhee hath any power to doe, is the principall controuerſie which is now in hand. To thoſe two Canons <hi>Nos Sanctorum,</hi>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:489:218"/>
&amp; <hi>Iuratos,</hi> which <hi>Suarez</hi> bringeth for his maine ground to proue that the <hi>Pope</hi> may for a time at leaſt wiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue Subiects of their allegiance, I haue ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered heretofore<note n="t" place="margin">Cap. 6. ſec. 3. nu. 12. &amp; ſeq.</note>, which anſwere may alſo be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that laſt Chapter <hi>de poenis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 And whereas <hi>Suarez</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication doth depriue not only of Sacred, but alſo of ciuill and humane communication, as is manifeſt by the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof and by the practiſe of the Church approued by perpetuall tradition,</hi> wee grant that the Church by the way of command may as I ſaid before borbid one to communicate ciuily with an excommunicated perſon, out of thoſe caſes wherein hee is not otherwiſe bound by the law of God to communicate, and this Doctrine is founded in holy Scripture; but, that this ciuill effect is annexed to Excommunication by the inſtitution of Chriſt or the Apoſtles, wee vtterly deny, and the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Excommunication, which <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe bringeth, doth manifeſtly ſhew the contrarie. Neither is it the practiſe of the Church approued by perpetuall tradition, that if a Prince bee excommunicated he is forthwith depriued of al humane Societie, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects commanded to void altogether his companie, as appeareth when Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> excommunicated <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius</hi> the Emperour and Saint <hi>Ambroſe Theodoſius.</hi> We grant that of late yeeres ſince ſome <hi>Popes</hi> haue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to them power to depoſe Princes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge Subiects of their Allegiance, they haue annexed to Excommunication the aforeſaid effect, but neither this opinion nor practiſe hath euer beene vniuerſally receiued, but alwaies contradicted by Catholike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Subiects and many learned men, and therefore it can not iuſtly be called the practiſe or the perpetuall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, as <hi>Suarez</hi> &amp; others are pleaſed to ſtile it, to make this opinion for the <hi>Popes</hi> authority to depoſe Princes to be more plauſible among the vulgar ſort.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 To conclude therefore, wee deny firſt that the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:489:218"/>
Catholike Church doth teach as a certaine Doctrine that ſhee hath authoritie to depriue Princes of their Regall authoritie either by ſentence of depoſition or by vertue of excommunication; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that it is as certaine that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authoritie to depoſe as it is certaine that he hath authoritie to excommunicate; &amp; I wonder that <hi>Suarez</hi> would aduenture ſo raſhly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame: For many Catholikes haue euer and doe to this day deny the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, who, neuertheleſſe doe willingly grant that he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to excommunicate them, neither are the grounds to proue the one and the other a like, ſeeing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is a ſpirituall puniſhment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreeable to the nature of a ſpirituall Common-wealth, but depoſition is a meere temporall puniſhment and therefore not ſo beſeeming the qualitie and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall communitie. And therefore in this ſecond part of this oath is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly nor couertly abiured the <hi>Popes</hi> power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, nor any other his ſpirituall authoritie, which is certainly knowne to belong to him, as I haue before declared; and of this opinion were thoſe <hi>thirteene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and learned Prieſts,</hi> who to <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> did make the like profeſſion in thoſe expreſſe words againſt which <hi>Suarez</hi> doth ſo greatly except.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Secondly, <hi>Suarez</hi> againſt thoſe words of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of the oath <hi>[And I wil do my beſt endeauour to diſcloſe all Treaſons which I ſhall know or heare of]</hi> maketh<note n="u" place="margin">Nu. 7. 8.</note> two obiections. The firſt is, <hi>that his Maiestie by the name of</hi> [treaſon] <hi>doth vnderſtand not only that which truly and in very deed is</hi> treaſon, but <hi>alſo all that which in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and according to the errors of the former clauſes is iudged treaſon. Therefore although the</hi> King <hi>ſhould by the</hi> Pope <hi>be lawfully depoſed, and the Subiects abſolued from the bond of their oath, and of their Allegiance, yet the King will call euery conſpiracie of the Kingdome, or of the Common-wealth or of the Subiects to thrust out the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:489:219"/>
King of his Kingdome, treaſon and a traiterous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, whereas in very deede it is not ſo, but a iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or a iuſt warre or puniſhment. Vnderſtanding therefore treaſon in this ſenſe, the exacting of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is vniuſt, and it were diſhoneſt and ſacriligious to ſweare it, both becauſe it is not treaſon, as I haue ſaid, for in that caſe is rather to be kept promiſe to the Common-wealth or to the communitie of Subiects being oppreſſed by force, then to the Tyrant who doth vniuſtly oppreſſe them, ſeeing that he is not now truly King; and alſo for that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſecrecie, vnder which the knowledge of ſuch a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie is had, doth at that time bind, becauſe it is of a iuſt thing and neceſſarie to the common good of the communitie, who doth iuſtly defend her ſelfe, and therefore a promiſe contrarie to that ſecret doth neither bind nor can be honeſt, and therefore neither can it religiouſly be ſworne, wherefore thoſe words, being taken by themſelues and ſolitarily to ſay ſo, may be without all ſuſpition, neuertheleſſe as they are conioined with the former, they are to he auoided, for that this later ſenſe ſeemeth eſpecially to bee intended by the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">

                        <hi>Suarez</hi> nu. 9. &amp; 13.</note>14. But to this obiection no other anſwere is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then to the former: for ſuppoſing that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authoritie to depoſe the <hi>King,</hi> nor to abſolue his Subiects from their Allegiance, it neceſſarily followeth that all ſuch conſpiracies are true and proper treaſons, and that therefore as I may lawfully acknowledge by oath, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power to depoſe the <hi>King,</hi> ſo alſo I may promiſe to reueale all treaſons and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, which are grounded vpon that falſe ſuppoſall that the <hi>King</hi> may truly be depriued of his Kingdome by the <hi>Pope.</hi> And in this ſenſe alſo did thoſe <hi>thirteene Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prieſts</hi> vnderſtand plots and conſpiracies, when they proteſted to detect all ſuch like Conſpiracies.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 The ſecond obiection is, <hi>for that it ſeemeth that I doe promiſe to reueale all treaſons although I ſhall heare of them only by Sacramentall confeſſion, and that this is
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:489:219"/>
the intent of the King and of thoſe who deuiſed this forme of ſwearing, may be gathered by this, that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them any Sacramentall confeſſion, and they make no account of the ſecrecie of this Sacrament, neither doe they make any difference betwixt that knowledge which is had by confeſſion, and white is had other waies. And therefore ſeeing that the King doth exact of his Subiects a promiſe to reueale all treaſons which they ſhall know of, Catholikes may iuſtly feare, yea and beleeue, that it is demanded of them without any diſtinction, whether they know it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or otherwiſe, and whether the diſcloſing of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ioyned with the diſcloſing of the Traitour, or with morall danger thereof. In which ſenſe that forme doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede ciuill obedience, and doth include ſomething againſt Catholike Religion. And therefore alſo for this cauſe the oath ought to be greatly ſuſpected, and therefore Catholikes and prudent men may demand a farther declaration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although for other cauſes they are bound ſimply to refuſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15 To this obiection we anſwere, that this manner of arguing, which the impugners of the oath do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſe, is not to be approued: to wit, <hi>The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth that he is ſupreme Gouernour of this Kingdome in all cauſes as well Eccleſiaſticall as temporall, therefore hee will bind his Subiects by thoſe words</hi> [Soueraigne Lord] <hi>to ſweare the ſame:</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>The King beleeueth that the Pope hath no power to excommunicate him, therefore hee will bind his ſubiects to acknowledge the ſame in this oath.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>The King beleeueth that thoſe lawes are iuſt, wherein it is enacted that the comming into this Land of Prieſts made beyond the Seas by the Popes authoritie, as likewiſe reconcilings to the Pope are treaſons and to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as in caſes of high treaſon, therefore its this oath by the name of</hi> Treaſons <hi>he will haue his ſubiects to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are ſame.</hi> We deny therefore that the <hi>King</hi> in this oath will haue his Subiects to acknowledge all that which he in his opinion thinketh to be true, or to doe
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:489:220"/>
that which a good Catholike may not with a good conſcience doe; but the <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> as both of them haue publikely declared, only demand the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that allegiance, which euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subiect, although he be a Catholike, may by the law of God and nature giue to their lawfull Prince.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Wherefore neither the <hi>Kings Maieſtie</hi> nor the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth binde Catholike Prieſts to reueale what they ſhall know by confeſſions, but ſo farre forth as by the law of Chriſt, and according to the vndoubted grounds of Catholike Religion, they are permitted: and therefore purpoſely perchance the <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Parliament,</hi> to giue as little occaſion as may be to Catholikes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the oath, doe exact of the ſwearer a promiſe to reueale all treaſons, and make no mention at all of the reuealing of Traitours; for that all Catholike Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines do acknowledge, as <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth<note n="*" place="margin">In this place.</note>, that Prieſts are bound to reueale thoſe treaſons which they ſhall heare of in confeſſions, and this oath ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing of reuealing the traitours, but how farre Prieſts are tyed to conceale the traitour, or not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the treaſon when there is danger that the traitour ſhal be reuealed, is an other queſtion, of which the oath maketh no particular mention, Let Prieſts who are compelled to take the oath looke to that, it is ſufficient that this obiection of <hi>Suarez</hi> doth nothing concerne Lay-Catholikes, for whoſe cauſe principally I compoſed this Diſputation, and therefore they notwithſtanding this obiection may lawfully take the oath; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoſe <hi>thirteene</hi> aforenamed <hi>Reuerend Prieſts,</hi> who proteſted to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to detect all plots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, inuaſions &amp;c. knew right wel in what account was the Sacrament and ſecreſie of confeſſion among Proteſtants, and neuertheleſſe they little thought by their proteſtation to derogate any iot from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith which they profeſſed.</p>

The firſt I proue: for by what authoritie doth the King compell his Subiects to ſweare that propoſition as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, which the Catholike Church hath not yet condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? And if the</hi> King <hi>doth ſay, that it is condemned in the Councell of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>where doth he reade in the Councell of Conſtance that particle,</hi> [Princes excommunicated or depriued by the Pope?] <hi>or that</hi> [by their Subiects or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other whatſoeuer?] <hi>Seeing therefore that theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles added to that propoſition do make it &amp; the ſenſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of far different, that propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a fallacious &amp; deceitfull inference is attributed to the Councell. But if the</hi> King <hi>doth condemne that propoſition not by the authoritie of the Councell but by his owne authoritie, he exceedeth doubtleſſe and abuſeth the power which he hath not.

For to deteſt by oath a propoſition as hereticall, doth plainly exceede ciuill obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is of a farre inferiour degree then it Chriſtian faith. Eſpecially when ſuch a precept is new in the Church, in ſuch ſort that the King doh not only compell a Chriſtian Subiect to deteſt a propoſition otherwiſe condemned by the Church (which a Catholike King obſeruing due manner may ſometimes doe) but alſo doth compell to deteſt a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which he newly again by his authoritie doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne, as now the King doth. Whereby it is alſo ſufficiently proued, that this oath is vniuſt in regard of the King, becauſe hee
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:489:221"/>
doth many waies exceede his authoritie, and ſo it is a violent compulſions and a vſurpation of an other mans Iuriſdiction: And in regard of the faithfull it is vniuſt to accept thereof, both for this generall reaſon, becauſe they ſhould ſweare ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an vnlawfull thing or an untruth; for if they beleeue that propoſition to he hereticall only for the Kings authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for this only it is damnable, and much more becauſe that propoſition, which is ſo condemned, is moſt true and certaine according to the true principles of faith, as hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the third booke; but if they outwardly abiure that propoſition, which inwardly they beleeue not to be hereticall, they commit manifeſt periurie, as of it ſelfe it is euident: And beſides this that propoſition doth containe a peculiar and proper iniurie againſt the</hi> Pope, <hi>whoſe power and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for feare of man they doe deny.</hi>

                     <hi>that this part of the oath doth alſo include an erroneous Doctrine. One error is that the Pope hath not autheritie to depoſe an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall or ſchiſmaticall King, and who doth peruert and draw his kingdome to the ſame ſchiſme or to the ſame here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For the profeſſion of this error is principally and more directly made by thoſe words then by others, as to euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it will forthwith appeare, and hath before beene proued many waies: The other error which truly in words is leſſe expreſſed, yet in the ſentence it ſelfe lyeth hidden and is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contained, is, that its theſe things, which do appertaine to the doctrine of faith and deteſtation of hereſies, a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral King may exact of his Subiects their faith alſo by oath. Yea alſo that in this the opinion of the King is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the opinion of the Pope.

Neither is it neceſſary to make that propoſition to be hereticall that the Scripture ſhould haue added, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill Princes who be excommunicated or depriued by Prieſts or Biſhops:</hi> It is ſufficient that all killing either of priuate men or of Princes is vnlawfull, and is by this precept forbidden, which is not warranted either in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scripture, or declared by the Church to bee lawfull, and to haue ſufficient warrant; now I would gladly know of <hi>Suarez,</hi> if hee will affirme, as I think he wil not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the aforeſaid poſition, <hi>Princes which be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,</hi> &amp;c. is not hereticall, where hee findeth that the Church doth giue ſufficient warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to euery man to

                  <p n="5">5 The ſcond anſwer was, that I do not ſweare the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid poſition to be heretical, but as hereticall in that ſenſe as I did there declare, which anſwere doth alſo ſufficiently auoid the difficulty which <hi>Suarez</hi> here doth make. Wherefore his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> doth not arrogate to himſelfe authority to condemne <hi>at his pleaſure</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as heretical, which are not hereticall, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the faithfull <hi>authentically</hi> what they ought to beleeue as a point of faith, as <hi>Suarez</hi> wrongfully impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vpon him, for this indeede were an exceſſe of ciuill authority to attribute to himſelfe power to define and determine any doctrine to be of faith, but he doth only compell his Subiects by temporall puniſhments, which are proper to the ciuill common-wealth, to abiure as hereticall that poſition which by all Catholikes is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as hereticall, which a Chriſtian Prince, as it is probably thought fit and neceſſary for the preſeruation of himſelfe, and of the temporall peace and outward quietnes in the common-wealth, may lawfully doe, as before<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 6. ſec. 2.</note> I haue ſhewed more at large.

                  <p n="6">6 And ſo the anſwere to the ſecond point is alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, it being almoſt a repetition of the former. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his <hi>Maiestie</hi> compell his ſubiects to abiure as hereticall that which is not ſo, neither doe they beleeue that it is ſo only for the Kings authority, but for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in holy Scriptures hath reuealed ſo, and by the common acceptance of the Church it hath euer bin vnderſtood ſo: And that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes they beleeue with moral credulity, for that many learned Cotholikes doe teach the ſame, and for that the contrary hath not as yet by any man, nor by <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelfe in his third booke beene ſufficiently

                  <p n="7">7 To the third point likewiſe wherin he ſcarce ſaith any thing which he hath not repeated before, wee haue already anſwered, that in this branch of the Oath is not abiured as hereticall the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes but onely to murther them in that ſenſe as wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared: Neither is it an errour to affirme that a Chriſtian King may vnder paine of temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments exact of his ſubiects by Oath a profeſſion of ſome points of their Chriſtian faith, when vpon prudent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues it ſhall be thought neceſſary to the preſeruation of the Kings perſon &amp; of his State, for that ſpiritual things not as they are ſpiritual but as they are te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral &amp; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary to the keeping of outward peace in the common-wealth, are ſubiect to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall power, eſpecially of a Chriſtian King, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they may be puniſhed, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently commanded or forbidden, for that the coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciue power in a Prince to puniſh ſuppoſeth the directiue power to command.

Seeing therefore that there is no hereſie, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or any other vnlawfull thing contained in this oath euery true Catholike may with a ſafe conſcience take it. And although the <hi>Popes Holineſſe</hi> hath forbid the taking of the ſame, yet his precept beeing meerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue and either grounded vpon falſe information, or at the moſt vpon a probable opinion, it is neither ſchiſme, nor ſin to contradict it, as before<note n="f" place="margin">cap. 10. ſec. 2.</note> I haue more at large declared.</p>

                     <hi>For it is againſt naturall reaſon to ſay, that any man cannot be abſolued from a promiſe confirmed by Oath, by changing the matter, and taking away and as it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king void the promiſe. For although one hath promiſed by oath to reſtore a pawne which he hath in keeping, if the other doth yeeld his right, he ſhall be freed from his oath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon if ſuch a change ſhould be made by a ſuperiour power, the obligation of keeping his promiſe will equally be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which alſo Triphon the Lawyer did acknowledge</hi> in leg. bona fide ff. Depoſiti <hi>ſaying,</hi> if one hath receiued a pledge with a promiſe to reſtore it to the owner, and the owner afterwards be condemned by the Iudge, and his goods ſhall be confiſcated, hee that hath the pledge is freed from his promiſe to reſtore it to the owner, and it muſt be brought into the publike treaſury. <hi>Becauſe as he ſaith beneath,</hi> the nature of iuſtice doth require, that faithfulneſſe, which is to be kept in a bargaine, is not to be regarded only in reſpect of them who made the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but alſo in reſpect of other perſons to whom that which is done belongeth, <hi>which eſpecially is true when the authority of a Superiour and the publike good do concurre. Neither will the King, as I thinke, make any doubt to exerciſe the like power in his kingdome, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:489:225"/>
for example ſake, a ſubiect of his goods, who is found to haue committed treaſon, and conſequently by tranſfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to himſelfe or to his treaſure all the the actions and promiſes made vnto him (that traitour) or doubtles by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them wholly and ſimply void, or by pardoning or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing the debters, by which it doth neceſſarily follow, that although they be confirmed by Oath, the debters are abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Oath. Therefore it cannot be denied, but that this manner of abſoluing from an Oath may bee iuſt and of validity, if in the abſoluer there be power to diſpoſe either of the matter of the Oath, or of the right of the creditor, or owner, or to whom the promiſe was made. Therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power to abſolue vaſſals from an Oath made to a King, who is an heretike or pernicious to Chriſtian Subiects, is moſt vniuſtly and againſt all reaſon denied to the Pope, or elſe it is denied vpon no other ground, but for that it is not beleeued that hee hath power to chaſtiſe and puniſh temporall Kings. And ſo this part is reduced to the former, and doth manifestly containe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of an errour againſt the Popes Primacie, and an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall aſſertion concerning the Kings Primacie, and of his abſolute exemption from obedience to the Pope, eſpecially for as much as concerneth his coactiue power by temporall puniſhments.</hi>

His chiefe therefore and onely ground, whereon all his principall exceptions againſt the Oath doe depend, is, as the Reader by his whole diſcourſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:489:226"/>
may eaſily perceiue, that it is hereticall and againſt faith to deny, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to abſolue Subiects from their allegiance, and this he oftentimes repeateth that hee hath ſufficientlie proued it in his third booke. But that hee hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it by euident demonſtrations, to which no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anſwere can be giuen, I haue alſo before by anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his arguments ſufficiently ſhewed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the inferences which hee deduceth from this ground to proue any particular clauſe of the Oath to containe in it hereſie or errour, can bee of no greater force then is the maine ground it ſelfe whereon they doe depend. Wherefore, ſeeing that hereſie is an errour contrary to God his holy word, either written or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by conſtant tradition, and ſo declared to be by the Catholike Church, not probably onely thinking ſo, but firmely and certainly beleeuing or defining it to be ſo, we earneſtly requeſt <hi>Suarez,</hi> as we haue already in this Diſputation requeſted the Reader, that hee will bring but one onely place of holy Scripture, or one onely definition of the Church, or one onely Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall argument drawne from the holy Scripture: or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny definition or tradition of the Catholike Church, and that he will inſiſt thereupon and vrge it as much as he can, that Catholikes may cleerly, diſtinctly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly perceiue the maine ground whereon in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult controuerſie of the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with all kind of temporall puniſhments by way of coercion, they are to build their faith vpon: and if it be ſo conuincing an argument, that I cannot giue to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probable anſwere, I will preſently yeeld and recall whatſoeuer I haue ſaide or written to the contrary. I know that he is able to bring probable, plauſible and colorable reaſons grounded vpon Scriptures or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, but this is not ſufficient, as he knoweth right wel, to produce a diuine and ſupernaturall beleefe which is a moſt certaine and vndoubted knowledge.</p>

by the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie (as being the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall member of the Empire in the Weſterne parts, who at that time had only in name and not in deed any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as in my Apologie<note n="n" place="margin">Nu. 413. &amp;c.</note>, I ſhewed out of <hi>Lupoldus</hi> and <hi>Coccinius,</hi>) but it was not done only by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but alſo by the conſent, ſuffrages, and authoritie of the people, as out of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds I proued in that place: And concerning that which Pope <hi>Bonifacius</hi> in the aforeſaid <hi>Extrauagant</hi> auerreth, wee alſo doe acknowledge, <hi>that the ſword is vnder the ſword,</hi> and <hi>that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall,</hi> and <hi>that all Chriſtians are ſubiect to the Pope,</hi> which is all that he in that place affirmeth, but this ſubiection is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in that manner as I before<note n="o" place="margin">Cap. 3. ſec. 1. nu. 13.</note> declared in this diſputation in anſwering an argument of <hi>Suarez,</hi> who doth there alledge this authoritie of Pope <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13 Neither doth his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> compell his Subiects to <hi>beleeue</hi> with a <hi>ſupernaturall beleefe,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no ſuch authority to depoſe Princes and to abſolue Subiects from their allegiance, but only to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profeſſion of their inward <hi>morall credulitie</hi> and perſwaſion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no ſuch authoritie, which being a thing credible, may by them with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be acknowledged; and being with all probable, that this right, liberty, and freedome of abſolute Kings, to wit, not to be dependent of the <hi>Pope</hi> in temporals, nor to be puniſhed by him with temporall puniſhments is a temporall right granted to all abſolute Princes by the law of God and nature, they haue good and full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to compell their Subiects to acknowledge the ſame, as the acknowledging thereof is thought pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be neceſſarie to the preſeruation of themſelues and of quietneſſe in the Common-wealth.

And ſo this part of the oath is reduced to the former, and doth not containe a profeſſion of any error againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall Primacie, or any acknowledgement of the <hi>Kings</hi> Primacie in ſpirituals, or of his abſolute exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but onely in thoſe cauſes and matters which probably are thought to be temporall and not to belong to the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as is power to depoſe Princes and to abſolue Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from their allegiance.</p>

                  <p n="16">16 To the ſecond obiection we anſwere by denying that in this clauſe is acknowledged the <hi>Kings</hi> ſupreme power in ſpirituals. For although that word [<hi>ſupreme</hi> authoritie] (which whether it was purpoſely omitted in the oath not to terrifie the ſimpler ſort is more then <hi>Suarez</hi> can know and proue) doth ſignifie all one with [<hi>full</hi> authoritie] yet <hi>full authoritie</hi> is in this oath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:489:229"/>
for ſupreme authority in the degree of ciuill and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authoritie. And although the <hi>King</hi> doth beleeue that in his Kingdomes he hath ſupreme authoritie in al cauſes, yet <hi>Suarez</hi> will neuer be able to proue, that the King <hi>in this oath,</hi> I ſay <hi>in this oath,</hi> did intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder thoſe words <hi>[full authoritie]</hi> al authoritie, both in ſpiritual &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall cauſes although, he thought &amp; meant y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was ſo full &amp; ſupreme an authoritie, that it was not ſubiect temporally to any power vnder God, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> could not abſolue any man from the performing of thoſe things which in this oath the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer promiſeth to performe, as in the Diſputation I haue more at large declared. Neither is this oath expreſly or couertly againſt that power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowen to be giuen to him by Chriſt, but againſt that power which learned Catholikes doe probably thinke not to belong to him: And ſo the <hi>Kings</hi> tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power miniſtring this oath, although it be not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall power, yet in temporall cauſes it is not ſubiect to it and in that reſpect may bee ſaid to be equall to it negatiuely, that it is not inferiour to it in ſubiection, ſpeaking only of temporall cauſes, as is the miniſtring of an oath of temporall allegiance, although in nobilitie it be farre inferiour to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power, to which alſo all powers among Chriſtians are ſubiect in ſpirituall cauſes. Neither doth the <hi>King</hi> determine or define any thing in this oath, which <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> doth ſo often inculcate, but only he compelleth his Subiects, as alſo I haue often repeated, to acknowledge and profeſſe that which they may lawfully profeſſe, and which hee may compell them to profeſſe, it being in it ſelfe lawful and probably thought neceſſarie to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties</hi> ſafetie, and to the outward peace and quietneſſe in the Common-wealth.</p>

            <p n="7">7 The matter doubtleſſe whereof we now doe treat, I confeſſe to be of very great waight, as beeing a thing which concerneth the ſupreame authorities of the Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill power, neither of this is there any controuerſie betweene vs. Wherfore theſe two things remaine onely to be examined; the firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing is contained in <hi>Widdringtons</hi> booke, which is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the common opinion of the Church or of Diuines; the ſecond, whether if there be any ſuch thing contained therein it bee affirmed without good authority. For if it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is contrary to the common opinion of the Church, or of Diuines, or if therein any ſuch thing be affirmed, it is not affirmed without good authority, hee will doubtleſſe auoid the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid imputation of <hi>temerity,</hi> and by the Law of <hi>Talio</hi> hee will with greater reaſon returne it backe vpon his Aduerſaries.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But firſt of all thou muſt obſerue, <hi>Learned Reader,</hi> (for to thee eſpecially I do direct my ſpeech) what is the marke at which <hi>Widdrington</hi> in his <hi>Apology for the Soueraignty of Princes</hi> doth aime, and what is the ſtate of the controuerſie betwixt him and Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for this once being knowne, thou maiſt more eaſily iudge whether iuſtly or wrongfully the aforeſaid crimes are laid to his charge. It is not therefore <hi>Widdringtons</hi> meaning, as ſome doe imagine, to impugne the more common opinion of Diuines, which granteth to the <hi>Pope</hi> authority to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as <hi>apparantly falſe,</hi> and with <hi>inuincible arguments</hi> to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:489:234"/>
the contrarie to be true, but whereas ſome very few later Diuines, and eſpecially Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> haue ſo egerly, and with ſuch vehemencie taken vpon them to defend this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Popes</hi> Holineſſe to depoſe Princes, that they imagine to haue moſt cleerely conuinced the ſame, and feare not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to charge with <hi>hereſie</hi> all thoſe Catholikes, who in this point doe not run with them, this only was my intent to giue at the leaſt a <hi>probable anſwere</hi> to the arguments of Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and to free vertuous and learned Catholikes from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable crime of <hi>hereſie,</hi> whereof they are wrongfully taxed, and ſo to ſhew out of his owne grounds, not by <hi>conuincing,</hi> but by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> reaſons, that his arguments are not altogether ſo <hi>certaine</hi> and inuincible, as that they doe <hi>euidently demonſtrate,</hi> that thoſe who deny ſuch an authoritie, are not to be accounted of the companie of the faithfull, or to be excluded from the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Wherefore the preſent controuerſie which is betweene me and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is not concerning this <hi>abſolute queſtion</hi> or propoſition, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> can or cannot depoſe Princes for hereſie or no, but concerning this <hi>modall propoſition,</hi> whether it be ſo certaine, that the Pope by Chriſt his inſtitution hath ſuch an authoritie to depoſe Princes, as that thoſe who defend the contrarie opinion, doe expoſe themſelues to manifeſt danger of <hi>hereſie, error,</hi> or of any other <hi>mortall ſin.</hi> Whereupon although in my <hi>Apologie</hi> I brought certain arguments drawne from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, which the Logicians call <hi>ad impoſſibile,</hi> to proue that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did not grant ſuch an authoritie to the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet whoſoeuer will diligently peruſe my <hi>Apologie,</hi> will preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that my intent was not to bring <hi>conuincing reaſons,</hi> which doe cauſe a <hi>firme &amp; vndoubtfull aſſent,</hi> but only <hi>probable</hi> and ſuch as are grounded vpon credible principles, and which are able to cauſe a <hi>probable perſwaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10 And from hence any man may plainly perceiue, that <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> doth not oppoſe himſelfe either againſt all Diuines, or againſt the common opinion of the Church or of Doctors, but only againſt very few writers; conſidering that among thoſe 70. <hi>Authors</hi> who are related by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> very few are to be found who (although they are perchance of opinion that the <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitution hath authoritie to depoſe Princes for enormious crimes) yet they doe not ſo peremptorily adhere to that opinion, as to taxe them with <hi>hereſie</hi> who doe maintaine the contrary. And if Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the later Editions of his Bookes, yet bringing no new reaſon to confirme his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion had no condemned the contrary opinion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes as <hi>hereticall,</hi> but had ſuffered euery man to perſeuere

From which principle, euen moſt euident by the light it ſelfe of nature, it doth moſt cleerely follow that the ciuil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may, vnder paine of temporall puniſhments, forbid all ſorts of ſeditious bookes,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Of this we haue a late example in the King of Spain that now is who vnder great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts did prohibite the eleuenth tome of Cardinall <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Story vntill it were corrected.</note> as they are ſeditious, &amp; do wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully infringe the lawfull rights of Princes, (as alſo the <hi>Pope,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpirituall puniſhments, may prohibit the ſame books as they are preiudiciall to the ſpirituall health of ſoules) and alſo that ſhee is not bound to admit into her dominions turbulent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and who are truely enemies to her temporall State, and who doe vnlawfully diſturbe the temporall quietneſſe of the Common wealth by other vnlawfull practiſes, then by the pure preaching of the Goſpel, which being performed in due manner is iniurious to no man: neither can theſe in my iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great ſcandall be called in queſtion.</p>

               <hi>concerning the compariſon of the Popes power, the one is of S.</hi> Thomas <hi>and many his followers and of other learned Doctors both Diuines and Canoniſts, that the Pope is aboue a Councell; the other is the common opinion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of Paris, and alſo of many Doctors, both Diuines and Canoniſts, as of</hi> Panormitane, <hi>and others contrary to the former, that a Councell is aboue the Pope. It is no place at this preſent to diſpute whether of them be the truer. I thinke that both of them is a probable opinion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either of them hath great followers, wee muſt not proceede in this queſtion which is in hand only according to one of theſe opinions, but we muſt determine what is to be ſaid what opinion ſoeuer of theſe two we do follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30 I could therfore wiſh, that theſe ſeuere Cenſours would in plaine and expreſſe words declare their opinion, and that they would not with cunning ambiguity of words keepe the Reader in ſuſpence, but ſincerely &amp; perſpicuouſly explaine their minds, and anſwere directly, whether thoſe that defend the opinion of the Doctors of Paris as probable, are in that manner <hi>tolerated by the Church</hi> as harlots, vſurers, and ſuch like notorious ſinners are ſometimes for the auoiding of greater ſcandals tolerated or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the common-wealth, who although oftentimes they are not puniſhed with ordinary puniſhments ordained by the lawes, yet they are altogether excluded from the participation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ſo long as they perſiſt in their wicked life; or whether thoſe who are reſolued to follow the opinion of the Doctors of Paris may enioy the benefite of Sacramentall abſolution? For if they will admit this laſt, they muſt of neceſſity confeſſe, that the opinion of the Doctours of Paris is not onely tolerated by the Church, but alſo allowed by the Church as probable, and which may be maintained without any danger of hereſie, errour or any other deadly ſinne.</p>
            <p n="31">31 Now that thoſe Doctors, who defend the opinion of the Diuines of Paris, are admitted to the Sacraments of the Church, the practiſe of the Church of France (which practiſe no man without great temerity and ſcandall can condemne as temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ſcandalous) doth giue apparant teſtimonie. Wherefore it ſeemeth in my opinion to bee farre more agreeable to Chriſtian charity, that vertuous and learned Catholikes ſhould as much as may bee, bee freed from error and hereſie, and more beſeeming the ſincerity of Chriſt his Goſpel, that Catholike Doctors ſhould
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:489:239"/>
plainly and perſpicuouſly, without ſo many ambiguities of words, declare to Chriſtian people what euery Chriſtian is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue concerning thoſe things which appertaine to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, and that they ſhould not ſo eaſily thruſt vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people doubtfull and vncertaine opinions, and which may be defended without preiudice to faith, for a certaine and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine of the Catholike faith. And from hence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the authoritie of no Prouinciall Councell, although it bee confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> if it be taken <hi>ſoly by it ſelfe</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">I ſaid <hi>ſoly by it ſelfe,</hi> for if it be approued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole Church it bindeth in that manner as a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth, as it is inſinuated in the next number.</note>, can bee ſuch a ſufficient argument to Catholikes, to giue vndoubted cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to her definitions, but that without note of <hi>hereſie</hi> or <hi>error</hi> they may be contradicted.</p>
            <p n="32">32 Neither is that obiection of the aduerſe part of any great moment: <hi>if the Pope,</hi> ſay they, <hi>defining without a Generall Councell doth not make that doctrine, which he defineth to be certaine of faith, but that he may erre, there could no certaintie haue beene had concerning many opinions which were taught in the three firſt hundred yeares, wherein many hereſies were put downe by the Pope, as it is euident in the errors of the</hi> Priſcillianiſts, <hi>of</hi> Vigilantius, <hi>of</hi> Iouinian, <hi>of the</hi> Maniches, <hi>and of many others.</hi> For according to the doctrine of the Diuines of <hi>Paris,</hi> the aforeſaid opinions of the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and of the reſt before mentioned, are not to be accounted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall for that cauſe preciſely, becauſe they were condemned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Pope</hi> or by <hi>Prouinciall Councels,</hi> but becauſe the whole Church receiued and approued their condemnation, which at this preſent for breuities ſake may ſuffice to haue inſinuated to the learned, being likely hereafter, if neede ſhall require, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it more at large.</p>
            <p n="33">33 Now let vs briefly examine what certaintie can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Councels</hi> for the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depoſe Princes. Six <hi>Prouinciall Councels</hi> and three <hi>Generall</hi> are produced by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to confirme this his opinion. And although <hi>Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Councels,</hi> according to the probable opinion of many, as wee now haue ſeene, doe not make the doctrine which they define to be certaine of faith, and therefore no conuincing argument can be drawne from them to condemne any doctrine of hereſie or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: yet that the truth may the better appeare, let vs grant for diſputation ſake that they cannot erre in their definitions, and let vs ſee how ſoundly Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his doctrine to be certaine of faith.</p>
            <p n="34">34 The firſt <hi>Councell</hi> which is alleaged by Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is a Romane Councell holden vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, in the yeare 1080, <hi>wherein</hi> Gregorie <hi>with the conſent and applauſe of all,</hi> as <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine ſaith</hi>

            <p n="45">45 But againſt this anſwere my Aduerſaries do firſt obiect: <hi>If the Councell of Lateran did not in that decree comprehend Emperours, Kings, and Soueraigne Princes, then what perſons are thoſe who there all called chiefe or principall Lords, or who haue no chiefe or principall Lords?</hi> And I demand of them againe, what perſons are thoſe, who in the Emperour Frederikes decree may iuſtly be called <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords,</hi> or who haue no <hi>Principall Lords?</hi> For the anſwere, ſo it be ſolide, which they ſhall make to my queſtion, will fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:489:241"/>
their owne obiection. Neuertheleſſe my opinion is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Councel nor the Emperor did by <hi>principall Lords,</hi> or <hi>who haue no principall Lords</hi> vnderſtand Emperours, Kings, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Princes who haue no Soueraigne aboue them in temporals, but onely thoſe Lords who do hold of Soueraigne Princes ſome territories, prouinces, or perchance alſo ſome kingdome in roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or as it were royall fee harme;<note n="q" place="margin">As with power to hang and draw and with other ſuch like princely Royalties.</note> by reaſon of which tenure they are made vaſſals to ſuch Soueraigne Princes, although them ſelues by vertue of the ſame tenure haue alſo Vaſſals vnder them, whoſe Lords they are, and by how the more or leſſe theſe Lords are exempted from the iuriſdiction of Soueraigne Princes, by ſo much the more or leſſe they may be called <hi>principall Lords.</hi> But let this ſuffice to haue breefly touched this for the preſent.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="47">47 To this obiection I did briefly in my <hi>Apologie</hi> giue many anſwers, which I thinke it not amiſſe to repeat heere again word by word. The firſt was,<note n="r" place="margin">Nu. 454.</note> that as well the Popes as Councells do oftentimes ordaine many things (the ordaining whereof doth belong rather to the ciuill then to the Eccleſiaſticall power) by expreſſe or tacite conſent of Soueraigne Princes, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent either in perſon or by their Ambaſſadours; or vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or hope at leaſtwiſe that Princes will ratifie the ſame. <hi>And this the expoſitours of the Canon law doe affirme,</hi> ſaith Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Pariſienſis,<note n="*" place="margin">De poteſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia et Papali cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For in cap. ad abolendam extra de Haereticis, wherein the Popes Holineſſe doth command the goods of heretikes to be confiſcated, Cardinall</hi> Hoſtienſis <hi>maketh this queſtion;</hi> what is this to the Pope concerning temporalls? <hi>And hee anſwereth with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Pope</hi> Innocentius: <hi>that in very truth it is nothing to him; but hee did this by the conſent of the Emperour, who beeing then preſent at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua gaue his conſent:</hi> Thus Ioannes Pariſienſis.</p>
            <p n="48">48. The ſecond anſwere I made in theſe words:<note n="ſ" place="margin">In the ſame place.</note> An other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the Gloſſe doth giue vpon the canon, <hi>Adrianus</hi> diſt. 63. where the Pope commandeth <hi>the goods of thoſe perſons who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his decree to be confiſcated,</hi> and vpon the Canon <hi>Delatori</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 6. where he decreeth <hi>the tongues of falſe promotours to be pulled out, and the heads of conuicted perſons to bee ſtroken off:</hi> For the Gloſſe doth anſwer, <hi>that the Church in theſe places doth teach what a Secular Iudge ought to doe.</hi> Which anſwere of his may be applied to other
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:489:242"/>
ſuch like decrees, wherein the holy Canons doe impoſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments: And this anſwere thoſe words of <hi>Sylueſter</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">In ſumma verbo paena nu. 9.</note> doe fauour, who writeth thus: <hi>Ioannes Andreas following Hoſtienſis is of opinion that a Biſhop cannot impoſe a pecuniarie mulct vpon a lay man who is not ſubiect to him temporally, but he muſt cauſe it to be impoſed by the Secular Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="49">49 To theſe anſwers may bee added, that whenſoeuer the <hi>Pope</hi> doth by a generall Decree ordaine any temporall thing which doth preiudice an other mans right, who is not his Subiect in temporalls, that decree, as ſome doe probably affirme, doth onely extend, vnleſſe the contrary be expreſſed, to the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Romane Church, or to the patrimonie of Saint <hi>Peter, wherein</hi> as Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſaith,<note n="u" place="margin">Cap. <hi>per venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem</hi> qui filij ſint legitimi.</note> 
               <hi>he doth exerciſe both the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the chiefe Biſhop, and execute the power of a Soueraigne Prince;</hi> Whoſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gloſſe vpon that chapter <hi>pervenerabilem</hi> doth ſeeme to fauour, who ſaith, <hi>that the Popes Holineſſe cannot legitimate any man who is not ſubiect to his temporall Iuriſdiction in ſuch ſort as that he may as a lawfull heyre by right ſucceed in an inheritance, for this were to put his ſith into another mans harueſt, and to vſurpe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Iuriſdiction, and to depriue a man of his right to ſucceed, which he ought not to doe,</hi> and therefore <hi>in the Secular court hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not legitimate vnleſſe the Prince ſhall permit him.</hi> But if the <hi>Pope</hi> can not make one legitimate who is not legitimate, or giue one right or depriue one of right to ſucceed: I cannot perceiue by what authority he can make a lawfull heyre and a lawfull Prince to be vnlawfull, and to haue no right, or to depriue one of that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which he doth lawfully poſſeſſe.</p>
            <p n="50">50 My third anſwere was, that the aforeſaid decree of the Councell of Laterane did not containe a matter of Faith but only of fact; wherein as well the <hi>Pope</hi> as thoſe Fathers following their owne opinions might erre, and that the Councell did not determine that the aforeſaid future ſentence of depoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould denounce againſt principall Lords, &amp;c. did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from authority which without all doubt was in it ſelfe lawfull, or from the ſole Eccleſiaſticall power without the conſent of Soueraigne Princes. And therefore the opinion of thoſe Fathers doth make no more certainty for the <hi>Popes</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depoſe Princes, then if they had declared their opinion out of the Councell: ſeeing that this only can be gathered from the vndoubted doctrine of the Catholike Church, that the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt is onely promiſed by Chriſt our Sauiour to the definitions and not to the facts and probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Popes or Councels.</p>
            <p n="51">51 I omit now that thoſe words <hi>[that from thence forth hee may declare his ſubiects to be abſolued from their Allegiance to him]</hi> doe
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:489:242"/>
containe ſome difficulty, for if wee will ſtrictly relye vpon theſe words, they ſeeme onely to ſignifie, that it belongeth onely to the <hi>Pope</hi> to declare the ſubiects to be already abſolued, and not truely and in very deede to abſolue them from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="52">52 But againſt this third anſwere my aduerſaries doe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently obiect: <hi>That doctrine, ſay they, doth appertaine to faith, which the Popes, Councells and Doctors doe either propoſe or ſuppoſe as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vndoubted ground and foundation of their decrees and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but this doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue ſubiects of their Allegiance, is either propoſed or ſuppoſed by the Popes, Councells and Doctors as a foundation of many Canons and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall ſentences, therefore this doctrine doth appertaine to faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="53">53 <hi>Moreouer, if a Generall Councell ſhould expreſly define that the Church hath this authority, no Catholike could make any doubt but that this matter did appertaine to faith, but ſeeing that the Councell doth ſuppoſe it as a ſure and certaine foundation of her decrees and ſentences, ſhe is thought no leſſe to affirme the ſame, therefore it ought to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no leſſe certaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54 <hi>Lastly, it is a point of Faith, that the Church cannot erre in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and precepts of manners, by teaching generally any thing to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which is vnlawfull, or to be vnlawfull which is lawfull, or alſo by commanding any thing which of it ſelfe is vnlawfull. For ſuch an error is no leſſe pernicious to the faithfull then is an errour in faith; but if the Pope ſhould not haue that authority to depriue temporal Princes of their dominions the Church ſhould erre in doctrine of manners, and that in matters of very great moment. For ſhee teacheth that after a Prince is depoſed by the Popes authority all his ſubiects are abſolued from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that his dominions may be poſſeſſed by an other, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the Councells. Alſo that after a Prince is publikely excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all his ſubiects are abſolued from their Oath of Allegiance: in ſo much that they are not bound to obey him vntill he be reconciled, yea and ſhe doth forbid them to obey him if the cenſure bee denounced. All which things ſhould be falſe, and not onely falſe, but alſo pernicious; for that thereby the Subiects ſhould be incited to rebellions and periuries, yea and againſt their wills be compelled thereunto: therefore the Church doth erre in doctrine of manners, and doth command rebellions &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and by her cenſures doth compell men thereunto; but to affirme this is hereticall, therefore that alſo from whence this followeth is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, to wit, that the Church hath not power to abſolue ſubiects from the bond of their Oath, and from their obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="55">55. Theſe bee the principall obiections againſt this third an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, wherein our moſt learned aduerſaries do greatly triumph, think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng that by them it is moſt euidently conuinced, that it is ſo certaine, that the Pope by Chriſt his inſtitution hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:489:243"/>
to depoſe Princes: that the contrary cannot bee defended without note of hereſie, or at leaſtwiſe of manifeſt errour. But let theſe Doctors, who are otherwiſe doubtleſſe moſt learned, take heed leaſt that they preſume to impoſe vpon the vnlearned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their priuate and vncertaine collections for vniuerſall and vndoubted concluſions of the Catholike faith; for truely that theſe arguments are not ſo forcible, as they imagine it may by the practiſe of the Church and the decrees of <hi>Popes</hi> very eaſily bee proued.</p>
            <p n="56">56 And firſt of all, is not the due adminiſtring of Sacraments a matter of great moment, and cheefly belonging to the <hi>Popes</hi> office, and is not an error concerning it to bee accounted moſt pernicious? But the Pope hath oftentimes giuen leaue to a prieſt who was no Biſhop to miniſter the Sacrament of confirmation<note n="x" place="margin">As it appeareth bp S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> lib. 3. epiſt. 26. and it is related in cap. <hi>peruenit</hi> diſt. 95. &amp; many Abbots at this day haue alſo this facultie.</note>, whereas it is a great controuerſie among Diuines, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> can giue leaue to ſuch a Prieſt to miniſter this Sacrament.

            <p n="59">59 May we not therfore according to our aduerſaries grounds argue in this manner? <hi>That doctrine doth appertaine to faith, which the Pope,</hi> (in whom only according to theſe Doctors<note n="e" place="margin">For they grant that the <hi>Pope</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without a Councell hath authority infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to define, and the Councell without the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authority at all infallibly to define, ſo that all ſuch authority is onely in the <hi>Pope</hi> and dependeth only on the <hi>Pope.</hi>

            <p n="60">60 <hi>Moreouer, if the Pope ſhould expreſly define, that the Church hath ſuch a power</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">To wit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vow of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and to giue leaue to a Prieſt who is no Biſhop to miniſter the Sacrament of confirmation.</note>, <hi>no Catholike (thoſe eſpecially who doe hold that the Pope defining without a Generall Councell cannot erre) could make any doubt but that this matter doth appertaine to faith, but ſeeing that the Popes doe ſuppoſe it as a ſure ground and foundation of their decrees and ſentences they are thought no leſſe to affirme the ſame, therefore it ought to be accounted no leſſe certaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="61">61 Laſtly, <hi>it is a point of faith, as our aduerſaries doe ſuppoſe, that the Pope cannot erre in doctrine and precepts of manners, by teaching generally any thing to be lawfull which is vnlawfull, or to be vnlawfull which is lawfull, or alſo by commanding any thing which of it ſelfe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.

Prince pretend right to the Crowne, yet the Pope may without doubt, according to our aduerſaries doctrine, command the Subiects, and by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures compell them to acknowledge the iſſue begotten by that marriage wherein hee did diſpence to bee their true, vndoubted, and lawfull Prince; all which things would be falſe, and not onely falſe but alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, for that thereby the Subiects ſhould bee incited to doe iniuries and againſt their wills ſhould bee compelled thereunto, and Princes ſhould obtaine free liberty to commit inceſts, and ſacriledges. The Church therefore doth erre in doctrine of manners, and doth councell ſacriledge, and command iniuſtice, and doth compell by cenſures thereunto; but to affirme this it is hereticall, therefore that alſo from which it followeth is hereticall, to wit, that the Pope hath not power to diſpence in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow of chaſtity, and to giue leaue to a prieſt who is no Biſhop to miniſter the Sacrament of confirmation;</hi> And neuertheleſſe neither of theſe are hereticall or erroneous according to the doctrine of thoſe Diuines but a little before cited. Let our aduerſaries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſolue theſe difficulties, and I will forthwith by their owne ſolutions vntie thoſe former knots which they imagine cannot in any wiſe be ſolued.</p>
            <p n="62">62 To conclude, are not the reaſons, for which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells are induced to define any thing of faith, as it were certaine grounds, which are by them propoſed or ſuppoſed as foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their definitions and decrees, and neuertheleſſe no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, as I ſuppoſe, will affirme, that thoſe reaſons are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by Catholikes with the ſame certainty wherewith the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions themſelues are to beleeued. <hi>In the Councells,</hi> ſaith Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

            <p n="63">63 Wherefore betwixt the voice, doctrine, and conſent of the Church firmely beleeuing, or defining any thing to bee of faith, and of the ſame Church probably, onely thinking there is doubtleſſe to be made a great diſtinction.

            <p n="66">66 Truly I haue often heard this booke to be meruailouſly commended by ſome men, and I cannot deny if it be true as they doe ſay but that it is written by a very learned man.

            <p n="67">67 Are you perchance afraid to publiſh among Catholikes, and thoſe eſpecially whom you certainly beleeue to erre in their beleefe, ſuch a booke, which doth moſt cleerely <hi>demonſtrate</hi> a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is to be beleeued of faith, and which therefore is neceſſarie to eternall ſaluation?
